BETWEEN:  
 Konvergo ERP S.A., having its registered office at Chaussée de Namur, 40, 1367
Grand-Rosière,  
 Belgium, and its affiliates (collectively referred to as “ODOO”)  
AND:  
 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,
a company having its registered office at  
 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
 (hereinafter referred to as “PARTNER”)

ODOO and PARTNER are individually referred to as a "Party" and
collectively referred to as "the Parties".

## 1 Purpose

The purpose of this agreement is to set forth the conditions under which
ODOO provides services to PARTNER, access to the Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition
software, and under which PARTNER complies with the obligations set out
hereafter.

ODOO hereby appoints PARTNER, and PARTNER hereby accepts the
appointment, to be a non-exclusive partner promoting and selling "Konvergo ERP
Enterprise Edition" to customers.

PARTNER commits to doing its best effort to sell Konvergo ERP Enterprise
contracts to its clients. To support that, PARTNER will market in
priority the "Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition" version to prospects and
customers. PARTNER still has the option to sell services on other
versions of the software, like "Konvergo ERP Community Edition", should it be
needed.

## 2 Term of the Agreement

The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be one year beginning
on the date of the signature. It is automatically renewed for an equal
Term unless either party provides written notice of termination minimum
30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.

## 3 Access to Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition

### 3.1 Project platform access

To help PARTNER promote Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition, ODOO grants PARTNER
access to its project code repository for all "Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition"
Apps, under the terms set forth in `appendix_p_a` and the conditions
restricted under this Agreement.

In addition, ODOO grants PARTNER free access to the ODOO.SH platform for
testing and development purposes.

### 3.2 Restrictions

PARTNER commits to keeping confidentiality of the source code of Konvergo ERP
Enterprise Edition Apps within its staff. Access to the source code of
Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition for customers is governed by the Konvergo ERP Enterprise
Subscription Agreement. PARTNER agrees to NOT redistribute this code to
third parties without the written permission of ODOO.

PARTNER commits to not offer services on Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition to
customers who are not covered by an Konvergo ERP Enterprise subscription, even
during the implementation phase.

Notwithstanding the above, PARTNER commits to wholly preserve the
integrity of the Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition code that is required to verify
the validity of usage of Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition and to collect
statistics that are needed for that purpose.

PARTNER is not allowed to block, restrict or limit in any way the
customer's access and use of the Konvergo ERP Enterprise Edition License,
without prior consultation and written authorisation from ODOO.

## 4 Partnership Services

### 4.1 Partnership levels

The Konvergo ERP partner program consists of two types of partnerships and four
levels; “Learning Partners” is for companies who want everything
necessary to start implementing Konvergo ERP, without visibility as an official
partner until they get the required experience; “Official Partners” is
for companies who want the visibility as Ready, Silver, and Gold,
according to their experience with Konvergo ERP.

Partnership level granted to PARTNER depends on the *net new Konvergo ERP
Enterprise users sold* in the last 12 months, the number of certified
resources and the customer Retention Rate. The *net new Konvergo ERP Enterprise
users sold* includes new customers, upsells on existing customer,
downsells on existing customers, and customer churn. Renewals of
existing contracts do not count towards the number of Users Sold, but
PARTNER still gets a commission on these contracts as stated in section
`benefits`.

The table below summarizes the requirements that have to be met for each
partnership level.

The customer *Retention Rate* is calculated by dividing the total number
of Konvergo ERP Enterprise customers acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years
that are currently active by the total number of Konvergo ERP Enterprise
customers acquired by PARTNER in the last 3 years.

</tbody>
</table>

Certifications are personal, so when a certified staff member leaves or
joins the company, PARTNER must notify ODOO.

PARTNER's partnership level will be reviewed quarterly by ODOO, and
adjusted to the highest level for which the 3 requirements are met.

However, "Official Partners" may be upgraded automatically to a higher
level once they reach the 3 requirements for that higher partnership
level.

### 4.2 Benefits

with PARTNER[^2] , ODOO will delegate the Maintenance of Covered Extra
Modules to PARTNER, who becomes the main point of contact of the

want to stop Working with PARTNER.

annual invoice sent by ODOO. The fee will be specified in writing at the
time of signature of this agreement.

provincial, state, local or other governmental taxes, fees or charges

associated with purchases made by PARTNER under this Agreement, except
when ODOO is legally obliged to pay or collect Taxes for which PARTNER

arising herein, and if such a breach has not been remedied within 30

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the liability of each Party for
any and all claims, losses, damages or expenses from any cause
whatsoever and howsoever arising under this Agreement will be limited to
the direct damages proved, but will in no event exceed for all
damage-causing event or series of connected events causing damages the
total amount for the fees paid by PARTNER in the course of the six (6)
months immediately preceding the date of the event giving rise to such
claim.

In no event will each Party be liable for any indirect or consequential
damages, including but not limited third parties or customer claims,
loss of revenue, profits, savings, loss of business or other financial
loss, costs of standstill or delay, lost or corrupted data arising out
of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement.

assurances that any investment made in execution of this Agreement and

Agreement.

The "Konvergo ERP" mark (including the word mark and its visual representations
and logos) is the exclusive property of ODOO.

ODOO authorizes PARTNER to use the "Konvergo ERP" mark to promote its products
and services, for the duration of this agreement only, as long as:

- There is no possible confusion that the service is provided by
  PARTNER, not ODOO;
- PARTNER does not use the word “Konvergo ERP” in their company name, product
  name, domain name, and does not register any trademark that includes
  it.

Both Parties shall refrain from harming the brand image and reputation
of the other Party, in any way whatsoever, in the performance of this
Agreement.

Non-compliance with the provisions of this section shall be a cause for
termination of this Agreement.

### 8.1 Publicity

PARTNER grants ODOO the non-exclusive right to use PARTNER's name or
trademarks in press releases, advertisements or other public
announcements.

In particular, PARTNER accepts to be mentioned in the official list of

used for this purpose only.

employee toward that end, the breaching Party agrees to pay the other
Party an amount of EUR (€) 30 000.00 (thirty thousand euros).

### 8.3 Independent Contractors

The Parties are independent contractors, and this Agreement shall not be
construed as constituting either Party as a partner, joint venture or
fiduciary of the other, as creating any other form of a legal
association that would impose liability on one Party for the act or
failure to act of the other or as providing either Party with the right,
power or authority (express or implied) to create any duty or obligation
of the other.

## 9 Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of Belgium. All disputes arising in connection with the Agreement
