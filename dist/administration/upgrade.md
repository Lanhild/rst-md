# Upgrade

An upgrade is the process of moving your database from an older version
to a newer `supported
version <supported_versions>` (e.g., Konvergo ERP 14.0 to Konvergo ERP 16.0). Frequently
upgrading is essential as each version comes with new and improved
features, bug fixes, and security patches.

Automatic upgrades: Konvergo ERP Online's Rolling Release process

The Rolling Release process allows Konvergo ERP Online customers to upgrade
their database directly from a message prompt sent to the database
administrator as soon as a new version is released. The invitation to
upgrade is only sent if no issues are detected during the automatic
tests.

![The upgrade message prompt on the top right of the database](upgrade/rr-upgrade-message.png)

It is strongly recommended to manually
`test the upgrade first <upgrade/test_your_db>`. Clicking
`I want to test first` redirects to [the database
manager](https://www.odoo.com/my/databases/), where it is possible to
request an upgraded test database and check it for any discrepancies.

It is **not** recommended to click `Upgrade Now` without testing first,
as it immediately triggers the live production database upgrade.

If the Rolling Release process detects an issue with the upgrade, it
will be deactivated until the issue is resolved.

An upgrade does not cover:

> - Downgrading to a previous version of Konvergo ERP
> - `Switching editions <on_premise/community_to_enterprise>` (e.g.,
>   from Community to Enterprise)
> - `Changing hosting type <hosting/change-solution>` (e.g., from
>   on-premise to Konvergo ERP Online)
> - Migrating from another ERP to Konvergo ERP

> [!WARNING]
> If your database contains custom modules, it cannot be upgraded until
> a version of your custom modules is available for the target version
> of Konvergo ERP. For customers maintaining their own custom modules, we
> recommend to parallelize the process by
> `requesting an upgraded database
> <upgrade/request-test-database>` while also
> `upgrading the source code of your custom
> modules </developer/howtos/upgrade_custom_db>`.

## Upgrading in a nutshell

1.  Request an upgraded test database (see
    `obtaining an upgraded test database
    <upgrade/request-test-database>`).
2.  If applicable, upgrade the source code of your custom module to be
    compatible with the new version of Konvergo ERP (see
    `/developer/howtos/upgrade_custom_db`).
3.  Thoroughly test the upgraded database (see
    `testing the new version of the database
    <upgrade/test_your_db>`).
4.  Report any issue encountered during the testing to Konvergo ERP by
    [submitting a ticket for an issue related to my future upgrade (I am
    testing an upgrade)](https://odoo.com/help?stage=migration).
5.  Once all issues are resolved and you are confident that the upgraded
    database can be used as your main database without any issues, plan
    the upgrade of your production database.
6.  Request the upgrade for the production database, rendering it
    unavailable for the time it takes to complete the process (see
    `upgrading the production database <upgrade/upgrade-prod>`).
7.  Report any issue encountered during the upgrade to Konvergo ERP by
    [submitting a ticket for an issue related to my upgrade
    (production)](https://odoo.com/help?stage=post_upgrade).

## Obtaining an upgraded test database

The [Upgrade page](https://upgrade.odoo.com/) is the main platform for
requesting an upgraded database. However, depending on the hosting type,
you can upgrade from the command line (on-premise), the [Konvergo ERP Online
database manager](https://odoo.com/my/databases), or your [Konvergo ERP.sh
project](https://odoo.sh/project).

> [!NOTE]
> The Upgrade platform follows the same [Privacy
> Policy](https://www.odoo.com/privacy) as the other Konvergo ERP.com services.
> Visit the [General Data Protection Regulation

Konvergo ERP Online

Konvergo ERP Online databases can be manually upgraded via the [database
manager](https://odoo.com/my/databases).

The database manager displays all databases associated with the user's
account. Databases not on the most recent version of Konvergo ERP display an
arrow in a circle icon next to their name, indicating that they can be
upgraded.

![The database manager with an upgrade button next to the name of a database.](upgrade/databases-page.png)

Click the **arrow in a circle** icon to start the upgrade process. In
the popup, fill in:

- The **version** of Konvergo ERP you want to upgrade to, usually the latest
  version
- The **email** address that should receive the link to the upgraded
  database
- The `Purpose` of the upgrade, which is automatically set to `Test` for
  your first upgrade request

![The "Upgrade your database" popup.](upgrade/upgrade-popup.png)

The `Upgrade in progress` tag is displayed next to the database name
until completion. Once the process succeeds, an email containing a link
to the upgraded test database is sent to the address provided. The
database can also be accessed from the database manager by clicking the
dropdown arrow before the database name.

![Clicking the menu arrow displays the upgraded test database.](upgrade/access-upgraded-db.png)

</div>

<div class="group-tab">

Konvergo ERP.sh

Konvergo ERP.sh is integrated with the upgrade platform to simplify the upgrade
process.

![Konvergo ERP.sh project and tabs](upgrade/odoo-sh-staging.png)

The **latest production daily automatic backup** is then sent to the
[upgrade platform](https://upgrade.odoo.com).

Once the upgrade platform is done upgrading the backup and uploading it
on the branch, it is put in a **special mode**: each time a **commit is
pushed** on the branch, a **restore operation** of the upgraded backup
and an **update of all the custom modules** occur. This allows you to
test your custom modules on a pristine copy of the upgraded database.
The log file of the upgrade process can be found in your newly upgraded
staging build by going to `~/logs/upgrade.log`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In databases where custom modules are installed, their source code
> must be up-to-date with the target version of Konvergo ERP before the upgrade
> can be performed. If there are none, the "update on commit" mode is
> skipped, the upgraded database is built as soon as it is transferred
> from the upgrade platform, and the upgrade mode is exited.
>
> Check out the `/developer/howtos/upgrade_custom_db` page for more
> information.

</div>

<div class="group-tab">

On-premise

The standard upgrade process can be initiated by entering the following
command line on the machine where the database is hosted:

``` console
$ python <(curl -s https://upgrade.odoo.com/upgrade) test -d <your db name> -t <target version>
```

The following command can be used to display the general help and the
main commands:

``` console
$ python <(curl -s https://upgrade.odoo.com/upgrade) --help
```

An upgraded test database can also be requested via the [Upgrade
page](https://upgrade.odoo.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In databases where custom modules are installed, their source code
> must be up-to-date with the target version of Konvergo ERP before the upgrade
> can be performed. Check out the `/developer/howtos/upgrade_custom_db`
> page for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> - For security reasons, only the person who submitted the upgrade
> request can download it. - For storage reasons, the database's copy is
> submitted without a filestore to the upgrade server. Therefore, the
> upgraded database does not contain the production filestore. - Before
> restoring the upgraded database, its filestore must be merged with the
> production filestore to be able to perform tests in the same
> conditions as it would be in the new version. - The upgraded database
> contains:
>
> - A <span class="title-ref">dump.sql</span> file containing the
>   upgraded database
> - A <span class="title-ref">filestore</span> folder containing files
>   extracted from in-database records into attachments (if there are
>   any) and new standard Konvergo ERP files from the targeted Konvergo ERP version
>   (e.g., new images, icons, payment provider's logos, etc.). This is
>   the folder that should be merged with the production filestore in
>   order to get the full upgraded filestore.

</div>

## Testing the new version of the database

It is essential to spend some time testing the upgraded test database to
ensure that you are not stuck in your day-to-day activities by a change
in views, behavior, or an error message once the upgrade goes live.

> [!NOTE]
> Test databases are neutralized, and some features are disabled to
> prevent them from impacting the production database:
>
> 1.  Scheduled actions are disabled.
> 2.  Outgoing mail servers are disabled by archiving the existing ones
>     and adding a fake one.
> 3.  Payment providers and delivery carriers are reset to the test
>     environment.
> 4.  Bank synchronization is disabled. Should you want to test the
>     synchronization, contact your bank synchronization provider to get
>     sandbox credentials.

Testing as many of your business flows as possible is strongly
recommended to ensure they are working correctly and to get more
familiar with the new version.

<div class="admonition">

Basic test checklist

- Are there views that are deactivated in your test database but active
  in your production database?
- Are your usual views still displayed correctly?
- Are your reports (invoice, sales order, etc.) correctly generated?
- Are your website pages working correctly?
- Are you able to create and modify records? (sales orders, invoices,
  purchases, users, contacts, companies, etc.)
- Are there any issues with your mail templates?
- Are there any issues with saved translations?
- Are your search filters still present?
- Can you export your data?

</div>

<div class="spoiler">

Example of end-to-end testing

- Checking a random product in your product catalog and comparing its
  test and production data to verify everything is the same (product
  category, selling price, cost price, vendor, accounts, routes, etc.).
- Buying this product (Purchase app).
- Confirming the reception of this product (Inventory app).
- Checking if the route to receive this product is the same in your
  production database (Inventory app).
- Selling this product (Sales app) to a random customer.
- Opening your customer database (Contacts app), selecting a customer
  (or company), and checking its data.
- Shipping this product (Inventory app).
- Checking if the route to ship this product is the same as in your
  production database (Inventory app).
- Validating a customer invoice (Invoicing or Accounting app).
- Crediting the invoice (issuing a credit note) and checking if it
  behaves as in your production database.
- Checking your reports' results (Accounting app).
- Randomly checking your taxes, currencies, bank accounts, and fiscal
  year (Accounting app).
- Making an online order (Website apps) from the product selection in
  your shop until the checkout process and checking if everything
  behaves as in your production database.

This list is **not** exhaustive. Extend the example to your other apps
based on your use of Konvergo ERP.

</div>

If you face an issue while testing your upgraded test database, you can
request the assistance of Konvergo ERP by [submitting a ticket for an issue
related to my future upgrade (I am testing an
upgrade)](https://odoo.com/help?stage=migration). In any case, it is
essential to report any problem encountered during the testing to fix it
before upgrading your production database.

You might encounter significant differences with standard views,
features, fields, and models during testing. Those changes cannot be
reverted on a case-by-case basis. However, if a change introduced by a
new version breaks a customization, it is the responsibility of the
maintainer of your custom module to make it compatible with the new
version of Konvergo ERP.

> [!TIP]
> Do not forget to test:
>
> - Integrations with external software (EDI, APIs, etc.)
> - Workflows between different apps (online sales with eCommerce,
>   converting a lead all the way to a sales order, delivery of
>   products, etc.)
> - Data exports
> - Automated actions
> - Server actions in the action menu on form views, as well as by
>   selecting multiple records on list views

## Upgrading the production database

Once the `tests <upgrade/test_your_db>` are completed and you are
confident that the upgraded database can be used as your main database
without any issues, it is time to plan the go-live day. It can be
planned in coordination with Konvergo ERP's upgrade support analysts by
[submitting a ticket for an issue related to my future upgrade (I am
testing an upgrade)](https://odoo.com/help?stage=migration).

Your production database will be unavailable during its upgrade.
Therefore, we recommend planning the upgrade at a time when the use of
the database is minimal.

As the standard upgrade scripts and your database are constantly
evolving, it is also recommended to frequently request another upgraded
test database to ensure that the upgrade process is still successful,
especially if it takes a long time to finish. **Fully rehearsing the
upgrade process the day before upgrading the production database is also
recommended.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Going into production without first testing may lead to:
>
> - Users failing to adjust to the changes and new features
> - Business interruptions (e.g., no longer having the possibility to
>   validate an action)
> - Poor customer experience (e.g., an eCommerce website that does not
>   work correctly)

The process of upgrading a production database is similar to upgrading a
test database with a few exceptions.

<div class="tabs">

<div class="group-tab">

Konvergo ERP Online

The process is similar to `obtaining an upgraded test database
<upgrade/request-test-database>`, except for the purpose option, which
must be set to `Production` instead of `Test`.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the upgrade is requested, the database will be unavailable until
> the upgrade is finished. Once the process is completed, it is
> impossible to revert to the previous version.

</div>

<div class="group-tab">

Konvergo ERP.sh

The process is similar to `obtaining an upgraded test database
<upgrade/request-test-database>` on the `Production` branch.

![View from the upgrade tab](upgrade/odoo-sh-prod.png)

The process is **triggered as soon as a new commit is made** on the
branch. This allows the upgrade process to be synchronized with the
deployment of the custom modules' upgraded source code. If there are no
custom modules, the upgrade process is triggered immediately.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The database is unavailable throughout the process. If anything goes
> wrong, the platform automatically reverts the upgrade, as it would be
> for a regular update. In case of success, a backup of the database
> before the upgrade is created.

The update of your custom modules must be successful to complete the
entire upgrade process. Make sure the status of your staging upgrade is
`successful` before trying it in production. More information on how to
upgrade your custom modules can be found on
`/developer/howtos/upgrade_custom_db`.

</div>

<div class="group-tab">

On-premise

The command to upgrade a database to production is similar to the one of
upgrading a test database except for the argument
<span class="title-ref">test</span>, which must be replaced by
\`production\`:

``` console
$ python <(curl -s https://upgrade.odoo.com/upgrade) production -d <your db name> -t <target version>
```

An upgraded production database can also be requested via the [Upgrade
page](https://upgrade.odoo.com/). Once the database is uploaded, any
modification to your production database will **not** be present on your
upgraded database. This is why we recommend not using it during the
upgrade process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When requesting an upgraded database for production purposes, the copy
> is submitted without a filestore. Therefore, the upgraded database
> filestore must be merged with the production filestore before
> deploying the new version.

</div>

</div>

In case of an issue with your production database, you can request the
assistance of Konvergo ERP by [submitting a ticket for an issue related to my
upgrade (production)](https://odoo.com/help?stage=post_upgrade).

## Service-level agreement (SLA)

With Konvergo ERP Enterprise, upgrading a database to the most recent version of
Konvergo ERP is **free**, including any support required to rectify potential
discrepancies in the upgraded database.

Information about the upgrade services included in the Enterprise
Licence is available in the
`Konvergo ERP Enterprise Subscription Agreement <upgrade>`. However, this
section clarifies what upgrade services you can expect.

### Upgrade services covered by the SLA

Databases hosted on Konvergo ERP's cloud platforms (Konvergo ERP Online and Konvergo ERP.sh) or
self-hosted (On-Premise) can benefit from upgrade services at all times
for:

- the upgrade of all **standard applications**;
- the upgrade of all **customizations created with the Studio app**, as
  long as Studio is still installed and the respective subscription is
  still active; and
- the upgrade of all **developments and customizations covered by a
  maintenance of customizations subscription**.

Upgrade services are limited to the technical conversion and adaptation
of a database (standard modules and data) to make it compatible with the
version targeted by the upgrade.

### Upgrade services not covered by the SLA

The following upgrade-related services are **not** included:

- the **cleaning** of pre-existing data and configurations while
  upgrading;
- the upgrade of **custom modules created in-house or by third
  parties**, including Konvergo ERP partners;
- lines of **code added to standard modules**, i.e., customizations
  created outside the Studio app, code entered manually, and
  `automated actions using Python code
  <studio/automated-actions/action>`; and
- **training** on using the upgraded version's features and workflows.
