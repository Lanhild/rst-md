# Closing tickets

Once work has been completed on a *Helpdesk* ticket in Konvergo ERP, there are
several ways it can be closed. Manually closing solved tickets keeps the
pipeline up to date, while automatically closing inactive tickets
prevents unnecessary blocking issues. Allowing customers to close their
own tickets minimizes confusion around whether an issue is considered
solved or not. This results in increased operational capacity for
support teams, and higher customer satisfaction.

## Manually close solved tickets

As work on a ticket progresses, it is moved along to the next stage in
the pipeline. Once the issue is solved, the ticket is moved to a
*folded* stage. This marks the ticket as *closed*.

To fold a stage, navigate to the `Helpdesk` dashboard and click on a
team to open the pipeline. Hover over a stage's heading, and then click
the gear icon that appears in the top-right corner of that stage's
kanban column.

> [!WARNING]
> Clicking the gear icon also displays the option to `Fold` the stage.
> This setting folds the stage *temporarily* to simplify the kanban
> view. This does *not* close the tickets in this stage. It also does
> not permanently fold the stage. If a stage needs to be folded so the
> tickets can be marked as closed, continue following the steps below.

From the menu that appears, select `Edit Stage`. This will open the
stage's settings. Check the box labeled `Folded in Kanban` towards the
top of the window, and then `Save & Close` to confirm the changes. Now,
tickets that reach this stage will be considered as *closed*.

## Automatically close inactive tickets

Tickets that are inactive for a set period of time can be automatically
closed. At that point, they will be moved to a folded stage.

Go to the team's settings page by going to
`Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Teams`. Under the `Self-Service`
section, enable `Automatic Closing`.

If one of the team's stages is set to be folded in the kanban view, it
will be the default selection in the `Move to Stage` field. If the team
has more than one folded stage, the stage that occurs first in the
pipeline will be the default. If no stage is folded, the default
selection will be the last stage in the pipeline.

The `After days of inactivity` field defaults to
<span class="title-ref">7</span>, but can be adjusted if necessary.

> [!WARNING]
> The `After days of inactivity` field does **not** take the working
> calendar into account when tracking the amount of time a ticket has
> been inactive.

If only certain stages should be used to track days of inactivity, they
can be added to the `In Stages` field.

<div class="example">

A team's pipeline is created with the following stages:

- <span class="title-ref">New</span>
- <span class="title-ref">In Progress</span>
- <span class="title-ref">Customer Feedback</span>
- <span class="title-ref">Closed</span>

Tickets can linger in the `Customer Feedback stage`, because once an
issue is solved, customers may not respond immediately. At that point,
the tickets can be closed automatically. However, tickets in the `New`
and `In Progress` stages may remain inactive due to assignment or
workload issues. Closing these tickets automatically would result in
issues going unsolved.

Therefore, the `Automatic Closing` settings would be configured as
below: - `Automatic Closing`: *checked* - `Move to Stage`:
<span class="title-ref">Solved</span> -
`After``7`<span class="title-ref">days of inactivity</span> -
`In Stages`: <span class="title-ref">Customer Feedback</span>

## Allow customers to close their own tickets

Enabling the `Closure by Customers` setting allows customers to close
their own ticket(s) when they determine that their issue has been
resolved.

Start by navigating to `Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Teams` and select
a team. On the team's settings page, scroll to the `Self-Service`
section and check the box for `Closure by Customers`.

Once the ticket closing settings are enabled, a `Close Ticket` button
will be available for customers when they view their ticket through the
customer portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Customers are able to view their tickets by clicking the
> `View the ticket` link they receive by email. The link is included in
> the `Request Acknowledgment` template, which is added to the first
> stage of a team by default. This link does not require a customer to
> have access to the portal to view or respond to their ticket.
>
> Customers with access to the portal will be able to view their tickets
> under `My
> Account --> Tickets`.
