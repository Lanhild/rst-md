# Project management

Konvergo ERP Project uses the **Kanban** project management system. This means
all projects are broken down into tasks, which are categorized on a
whiteboard according to what production phase they are in.

Did you know?

The word **Kanban** comes from Japanese and refers to the "visual board"
management method.

## Configuration

Open the **Project** app and click `Create` to start a new project.
Enter a `Name` for your project and click `Create Project`.

You can customize your existing **projects** from the dashboard by
clicking the drop-down toggle button (`â‹®`) on your project's **card**.

This enables a new menu divided into four parts:

- `View`: see an overview of your project's components, such as its
  `Tasks`, `Milestones` and `Project Updates`. Depending on which apps
  you have activated, more options may be available, such as
  `Documents`. All uploaded files can be found under this menu, as well
  as in the **Documents** app, under `Projects`;
- `Reporting`: analyze your project's progress and profitability through
  graphics and statistics;
- **Color**: make a line of color appear on the left side of the card so
  that your project is more recognizable;
- `Settings`: you can change the following:
  - the `Name` of the project;
  - the `Name of the tasks` found under that project;
  - the `Customer` for whom the project is intended;
  - the `Tags` used for filtering;
  - the `Company` responsible for the project;
  - the employee designated as `Project Manager`;
  - the `Planned Date` of the project;
  - the total `Allocated Hours` for that project.

Additionally, you can mark the project as `Favorite`, allowing you to
find it using the `My Favorites` filter on the Kanban view;

Further settings are available under the `Settings` tab. Most of them
are *only* available depending on the activated apps.

## Scheduling activities

You can schedule **activities** (ex. `Call`, `Meeting`, etc.) per
project by clicking on the **clock** icon on a project. Doing so opens a
list with already scheduled activities and allows planning **new**
activities by clicking `+ Schedule an activity`. On the pop-up window,
select the `Activity Type`, enter a `Summary` for that activity, a
`Due Date`, and assign it to an employee. According to the
`Activity Type`, you may have **additional options** available.

> [!NOTE]
> If an activity is **already** scheduled, the icon may change to a
> **phone**, **group of people**, or other.
