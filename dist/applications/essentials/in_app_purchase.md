# In-app purchases (IAP)

In-app purchases (IAP) are optional services that enhance Odoo
databases. Each service provides its own specific features and
functionality. A full list of services is available on the [Odoo IAP
Catalog](https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services).

alt="The IAP catalog with various services available on IAP.Odoo.com." />

<div class="example">

The `SMS` service sends text messages to contacts directly from the
database, and the `Documents Digitization` service digitizes scanned or
PDF vendor bills, expenses, and resumes with optical character
recognition (OCR) and artificial intelligence (AI).

</div>

`IAP (In-app purchases)` services do **not** need to be configured or
set up before use. Odoo users can simply click on the service in the app
to activate it. However, each service requires its own prepaid credits,
and when they run out, users **must** `buy more <iap/buying_credits>` in
order to keep using it.

> [!NOTE]
> Enterprise Odoo users with a valid subscription get free credits to
> test IAP features before deciding to purchase more credits for the
> database. This includes demo/training databases, educational
> databases, and one-app-free databases.

### Use IAP services

`IAP (In-app purchases)` services are automatically integrated with
Odoo, and do **not** require users to configure any settings. To use a
service, simply interact with it wherever it appears in the database.

<div class="example">

The following flow focuses on the *SMS* `IAP (In-app purchases)` service
being used from a contact's record.

This can be done by clicking the `üì± SMS` icon within the database.

alt="The SMS icon on a typical contact information form located within an Odoo database." />

One way to utilize the *SMS* `IAP (In-app purchases)` service with Odoo
is showcased in the following steps:

First, navigate to the `Contacts application`, and click on a contact
with a mobile phone number entered in either the `Phone` or `Mobile`
field of the contact form.

Next, find the `üì± SMS` icon that appears to the right of the `Phone` or
`Mobile` fields. Click the `üì± SMS` icon, and a `Send SMS Text
Message` pop-up window appears.

Type a message in the `Message` field of the pop-up window. Then, click
the `Send SMS` button. Odoo then sends the message, via SMS, to the
contact, and logs what was sent in the *chatter* of the contact's form.

Upon sending the SMS message, the prepaid credits for the *SMS*
`IAP (In-app purchases)` service are automatically deducted from the
existing credits. If there are not enough credits to send the message,
Odoo prompts the user to purchase more.

services, and for more in-depth instructions related to SMS
functionality in Odoo, review the documentation below:

- `Enrich your contacts base with Partner Autocomplete

- `SMS essentials <../marketing/sms_marketing/essentials/sms_essentials>`

</div>

## IAP credits

Every time an `IAP (In-app purchases)` service is used, the prepaid
credits for that service are spent. Odoo prompts the purchase of more
credits when there are not enough credits left to continue using a
service. Email alerts can also be set up for when
`credits are low <in_app_purchase/low-credits>`.

Credits are purchased in *Packs* from the [Odoo IAP
Catalog](https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services), and pricing is
specific to each service.

<div class="example">

The [SMS service](https://iap.odoo.com/iap/in-app-services/1) has four
packs available, in denominations of:

- `Starter Pack`: 10 credits
- `Standard Pack`: 100 credits
- `Advanced Pack`: 500 credits
- `Expert Pack`: 1,000 credits

<img src="in_app_purchase/packs.png" class="align-center"
alt="Four different packs of credits for the SMS IAP service." />

The number of credits consumed depends on the length of the SMS and the
country of destination.

For more information, refer to the `SMS Pricing and FAQ
<../marketing/sms_marketing/pricing/pricing_and_faq>` documentation.

### Buy credits

If there are not enough credits to perform a task, the database
automatically prompts the purchase of more credits.

Users can check the current balance of credits for each service, and
manually purchase more credits, by navigating to the
`Settings app --> Contacts section`, and beneath the `Odoo IAP` setting,
click `View My Services`.

Doing so reveals a `My Services` page, listing the various
`IAP (In-app purchases)` services in the database. From here, click an
`IAP (In-app purchases)` service to open its `Account Information` page,
where additional credits can be purchased.

#### Manually buy credits

To manually buy credits in Odoo, follow these steps:

First, go to the `Settings application` and type
<span class="title-ref">IAP</span> in the `Search...` bar. Alternatively
users can scroll down to the `Contacts` section. Under the `Contacts`
section, where it says `Odoo IAP`, click `View My
Services`.

Doing so reveals an `IAP Account` page, listing the various
`IAP (In-app purchases)` services in the database. From here, click an
`IAP (In-app purchases)` service to open details about it; additional
credits can be purchased from here.

On the following page, click the `Buy Credit` button. Doing so loads a
`Buy
Credits for (IAP Account)` page in a new tab. From here, click `Buy` on
the desired pack of credits. Then, follow the prompts to enter payment
details, and confirm the order.

Once the transaction is complete, the credits are available for use in
the database.

#### Low-credit notification

It is possible to be notified when credits are low, in order to avoid
running out of credits, while using an `IAP (In-app purchases)` service.
To do that, follow this process:

Go to the `Settings application`, and type
<span class="title-ref">IAP</span> in the `Search...` bar. Under the
`Contacts` section, where it says `Odoo IAP`, click `View My
Services`.

The available `IAP (In-app purchases)` accounts appear in a list view on
the `IAP Account` page. From here, click on the desired
`IAP (In-app purchases)` account to view that service's details.

On the details page, tick the `Receive threshold warning` checkbox.
Doing so reveals two fields on the form: `Warning Threshold` and
`Contact Email`.

In the `Warning Threshold` field, enter an amount of credits Odoo should
use as the minimum threshold for this service. In the `Contact Email`
field, enter the email address that receives the notification.

Odoo sends a low-credit alert to the `Contact Email` when the balance of
credits falls below the amount listed as the `Warning Threshold`.
