# Digest emails

*Digest Emails* are periodic snapshots sent via email to users in an
organization that include high-level information about how the business
is performing.

To start sending digest emails, begin by navigating to
`Settings app --> Statistics
section`, activate the `Digest Emails` feature, and click `Save`.

alt="Digest Emails section inside General Settings." />

A variety of settings can be configured for digest emails, such as:

- Deciding which `KPIs (key performance indicators)` are shared in the
  digest emails
- Determining how often digest emails are sent
- Choosing who in the organization receives digest emails
- Creating custom digest email templates
- Adding additional `KPIs (key performance indicators)` (*Studio* app
  required)

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the `Digest Email` feature is enabled. `Your Odoo Periodic
> Digest` serves as the primary template, which includes all
> `KPI (key performance
> indicator)` measurements across the Odoo database, and is sent daily
> to administrators.

> [!WARNING]
> When creating duplicates of databases that have sending capabilities
> (not testing-mode), the digest emails continue to send from the
> duplicate database, unless deactivated.
>
> To deactivate the digest email, navigate to
> `Settings --> Statistics section`. Then, deactivate the
> `Digest Emails` feature, by un-ticking the checkbox, and clicking
> `Save`. See the section on `digest-emails/deactivate`.

## Customize default digest email

To customize the default digest email (*Your Odoo Periodic Digest*), go
to `Settings
app --> Statistics section --> Digest Email field`. Then, select
`Your Odoo Periodic
Digest`, and click on the `‚ÜóÔ∏è (External link)` icon, next to the
drop-down menu selection.

A pop-up window appears, and presents a variety of editable settings,
which include:

- `Digest Name`: the name of the digest email.
- `Periodicity`: control how often digest emails are sent (`Daily`,
  `Weekly`, `Monthly`, or `Quarterly`).
- `Next Send Date`: the date on which the digest email will be sent
  again.
- `KPIs` tab: check/uncheck each calculated
  `KPI (key performance indicator)` that appears in digest emails. A
  ticked box indicates an active `KPI (key performance indicator)` in
  the digest email. See the section on `digest-emails/kpis`.
- `Recipients` tab: add/remove users who receive the digest emails. See
  the section on `digest-emails/recipients`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `KPIs (key performance indicators)` can be customized using Odoo
> *Studio*. Additional costs to the database subscription are incurred
> should *Studio* need to be installed. See this section on
> `digest-emails/custom-kpi`.

## Create digest emails

To create a new digest email, navigate to

email.

A separate page, with a blank digest email template appears, and
presents a variety of editable settings, including:

- `Digest Name`: the name of the digest email.
- `Periodicity`: control how often digest emails are sent (`Daily`,
  `Weekly`, `Monthly`, or `Quarterly`).
- `Next Send Date`: the date on which the digest email will be sent
  again.
- `KPIs` tab: check/uncheck each calculated
  `KPI (key performance indicator)` that appears in digest emails. A
  ticked box indicates an active `KPI (key performance indicator)` in
  the digest email. See the section on `digest-emails/kpis`.
- `Recipients` tab: add/remove users who receive the digest emails. See
  the section on `digest-emails/recipients`.

From there, give the digest email a `Digest Name`, specify
`Periodicity`, choose the desired `KPIs (key performance indicators)`,
and add `Recipients`, as needed.

After clicking `Save`, the new custom digest email is available as a
selection in the `Digest Email` field, located in the
`Settings app --> Statistics section`.

## Custom KPIs with Odoo Studio

The `KPIs (key performance indicators)` on a digest email template form,
in the `KPIs` tab, can be customized using Odoo *Studio*.

> [!WARNING]
> Additional costs to the database subscription are incurred, should
> Odoo *Studio* need to be installed.

To begin, click the `üõ†Ô∏è (tools)` icon in the top-right of the screen.
This is the link to the Odoo *Studio* application.

In order to create additional fields, create two fields on the digest
object:

1.  Create a boolean field called
    <span class="title-ref">kpi_myfield</span>, and display it in the
    `KPIs` tab.
2.  Create a computed field called
    <span class="title-ref">kpi_myfield_value</span> that computes the
    customized `KPI (key
    performance indicator)`.
3.  Select the `KPIs (key performance indicators)` in the `KPIs` tab.

> [!TIP]
> Here is the [source
> code](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/15.0/addons/digest/models/digest.py)
> for the <span class="title-ref">digest.py</span> file, which guides
> the programmer in the coding of the computed field.

Users can also click the `Recipients` tab, and then the vertical
three-dot `(kebab)` menu to edit this view. Either click
`EDIT LIST VIEW` or `EDIT FORM VIEW` to modify this tab.
