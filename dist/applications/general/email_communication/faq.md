# Email issues

This document contains an explanation of the most recurring emailing
issues in Konvergo ERP.

## Outgoing emails

### Email is not sent

The first indicator showing that an email has not been sent is the
presence of a red `‚úâÔ∏è
(envelope)` icon, next to the date and time of the message, located in
the chatter.

alt="Red envelope icon displayed in chatter." />

Unsent emails also appear in the Konvergo ERP email queue. In
`developer mode <developer-mode>`, the email queue can be accessed by
going to `Settings app --> Technical menu --> Email
--> Emails`. Unsent emails appear in turquoise, while sent emails appear
in grey.

#### Common error messages

##### Daily limit reached

<img src="faq/email-limit.png" class="align-center"
alt="Warning in Konvergo ERP upon email limit reached." />

Each email service provider has its own email sending limits. The limits
may be daily, hourly, or sometimes, per minute. This is the same for
Konvergo ERP, which limits a customer's sending to prevent Konvergo ERP's email servers
from being blacklisted.

Here are the default limits for new databases:

- **200 emails per day** for Konvergo ERP Online and Konvergo ERP.sh databases with an
  active subscription.
- **20 emails per day** for one-app free databases.
- **50 emails per day** for trial databases.
- In the case of migration, the daily limit might be reset to 50 emails
  per day.

If the daily limit is reached:

- Contact the Konvergo ERP support team, who may increase the daily limit
  depending on the following factors:
  1.  How many users are in the database?
  2.  Which apps are installed?
  3.  The bounce rate: the percentage of email addresses that did not
      receive emails because they were returned by a mail server on its
      way to the final recipient.
- Use an external outgoing email server to be independent of Konvergo ERP's mail
  limit (refer to the corresponding `email documentation
  </applications/general/email_communication/email_servers>`).
- Wait until 11 PM (UTC) for the daily limit to reset, and retry sending
  the email. In `developer mode <developer-mode>`, go to
  `Settings app --> Technical menu -->
  Email --> Emails`, then click the `Retry` button next to an unsent
  email.

> [!WARNING]
> The daily email limit is comprehensive to the database. By default,
> any internal message, notification, logged note, etc. counts as an
> email in the daily limit if it notifies someone via email. This can be
> mitigated by receiving `notifications in Konvergo ERP
> <discuss_app/notification_preferences>`, instead of emails.

##### SMTP error

Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) error messages explain why an
email wasn't transmitted successfully.
`SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol)` is a protocol to describe the
email structure, and transmits data from messages over the Internet. The
error messages generated by email services are helpful tools to diagnose
and troubleshoot email problems.

<div class="example">

This is an example of a 554 SMTP permanent delivery error:
<span class="title-ref">554: delivery error: Sorry, your message to
------@yahoo.com cannot be delivered. This mailbox is disabled
(554.30). - mta4471.mail.bf1.yahoo.com --- Below this line is a copy of
the message.</span>

</div>

The debug menu can be used to investigate SMTP sending issues from a
database. To access the menu, `developer mode <developer-mode>` must be
activated. Once activated, navigate to the `Debug Menu` in the top right
of the menu bar (the `üêû (bug)` icon), `Debug Menu --> Manage Messages`

The `Manage Messages` menu opens a list of all the messages sent in a
particular record. Within each message there is information on sending,
including the type, and subtype, of the message.

Other information includes to whom the message was sent, and whether
Konvergo ERP received a bounce-back message from an email server.

> [!NOTE]
> A user must be on a view in Konvergo ERP that has a chatter in order for the
> `Manage Messages` menu option to appear.

###### No error populated

Konvergo ERP is not always capable of providing information for the reason it
failed. The different email providers implement a personalized policy of
bounced emails, and it is not always possible for Konvergo ERP to interpret it
correctly.

If this is a recurring problem with the same client, or the same domain,
do not hesitate to contact [Konvergo ERP Support](https://www.odoo.com/help) for
help in finding a reason.

> [!NOTE]
> One of the most common reasons for an email failing to send with no
> error message is related to `SPF <email_communication/spf_compliant>`
> and/or `DKIM
> <email_communication/DKIM_compliant>` configuration. Also, check to
> make sure the <span class="title-ref">mail.bounce.alias</span> is
> defined in the *system parameters*. Access system parameters in
> `developer mode <developer-mode>` by navigating to `Settings app -->
> Technical menu --> Parameters --> System Parameters`.

### Email is sent late

Email campaigns send at a scheduled time, using a delay pre-programed in
the database. Konvergo ERP uses a delayed task to send emails that are
considered "not urgent" (newsletter formats, such as: mass mailing,
marketing automation, and events). The system utility **cron** can be
used to schedule programs to run automatically at predetermined
intervals. Konvergo ERP uses that policy in order to avoid cluttering the mail
servers and, instead, prioritizes individual communication. This
**cron** is called `Mail: Email Queue Manager`, and can be accessed in
`developer mode
<developer-mode>` by going to
`Settings app --> Technical menu --> Automation -->
Scheduled Actions`.

<img src="faq/email-scheduled-later.png" class="align-center"
alt="Email scheduled to be sent later." />

> [!TIP]
> What is a **cron**? A cron is an action that Konvergo ERP runs in the
> background to execute particular code to complete a task.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, the *Mass Mailing cron* runs every 60 minutes. This can be
> changed to no less than 5 minutes. However, running the action every 5
> minutes would bog down the Konvergo ERP database (stress the system), so this
> is not recommended. To edit the mass mailing cron, select the
> scheduled action `Mail: Email Queue Manager`, and proceed to make any
> necessary adjustments.

Emails that are considered urgent (communication from one person to
another, such as sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, etc.) are sent
immediately.

## Incoming emails

When there is an issue with incoming emails, there might not be an
indication, per se, in Konvergo ERP. It is the sending email client, who tries
to contact a database, that will get a bounce-back message (most of the
time a `550: mailbox unavailable` error message).

### Email is not received

The steps that should be taken depend on the Konvergo ERP platform where the
database is hosted.

**Konvergo ERP.sh** users can find their live logs on the folder `~/logs/`.

Logs are a stored collection of all the tasks completed in a database.
They are a text-only representation, complete with timestamps of every
action taken on the Konvergo ERP database. This can be helpful to track emails
leaving the database. Failure to send can also be seen by logs that
indicate that the message tried to send repeatedly. Logs will show every
action to the email servers from the database.

The folder `~/logs/` (accessed by the command line or on the Konvergo ERP.sh
dashboard) of an Konvergo ERP.sh database contains a list of files containing
the logs of the database. The log files are created everyday at 5:00 AM
(UTC).

> [!TIP]
> The two most recent days (today and yesterday) are not compressed,
> while the older ones are, in order to save space. The naming of the
> files for today and yesterday are respectively: `odoo.log` and
> `odoo.log.1`.
>
> For the following days, they are named with their dates, and then
> compressed. Use the command `grep` and `zgrep` (for the compressed
> ones) to search through the files.

<div class="seealso">

For more information on logs and how to access them via the Konvergo ERP.sh
dashboard, see `this
administration documentation <odoosh/logs>`.

For more information on accessing logs via the command line visit
`this developer
documentation <reference/cmdline/server/logging>`.

</div>

**Konvergo ERP Online** users won't have access to the logs. However [Konvergo ERP
Support](https://www.odoo.com/help) can be contacted if there is a
recurring issue with the same client or domain.

## Get help from Konvergo ERP support

In order to get helped efficiently, please provide as much information
as possible. Here is a list of what can be helpful when reaching out to
the Konvergo ERP Support team about an issue:

1.  Send a copy of the email headers. The
    <span class="title-ref">.EML</span> file (or **headers**) of the
    email is the file format containing all the technical information
    required for an investigation. The documentation from the email
    provider might explain how to access the EML file/header files. Once
    the headers of the email are obtained, adding it into the Konvergo ERP
    Support ticket is the most efficient way for the Konvergo ERP Support team
    to investigate.

    <div class="seealso">

      headers](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436)

    </div>

2.  Explain the exact flow that is being followed to normally receive
    those emails in Konvergo ERP. Here are examples of questions whose answers
    can be useful:

    - Is this a notification message from a reply being received in
      Konvergo ERP?
    - Is this a message being sent from the Konvergo ERP database?
    - Is there an incoming email server being used, or is the email
      somehow being redirected?
    - Is there an example of an email that has been correctly forwarded?

3.  Provide answers to the following questions:

    - Is it a generic issue, or is it specific to a use case? If
      specific to a use case, which one exactly?
    - Is it working as expected? In case the email is sent using Konvergo ERP,
      the bounce email should reach the Konvergo ERP database, and display the
      `red envelope <red_envelop>`.

> [!NOTE]
> The bounce system parameter needs to be set in the technical settings
> in order for the database to correctly receive bounce messages. To
> access this setting, go to `Settings app
> --> Technical menu --> Parameters --> System Parameters`. Then select
> the parameter name `mail.bounce.alias` and set the value to
> <span class="title-ref">bounce</span> if it isn't already set.
