Mail Plugins are connectors that bridge your mailbox with your Konvergo ERP
database. With them, you can interact with your Konvergo ERP database directly
from your mailbox by:

- Creating leads and centralizing prospects' emails into the CRM app.
- Generating tasks in any Konvergo ERP project.
- Creating tickets in the Helpdesk app.
- Searching and storing insights on your contacts.

Mail Plugins are available for `Outlook <mail_plugins/outlook>` and
`Gmail
<mail_plugins/gmail>`.

## Pricing

Mail Plugins are **free** to install and use.

However, they can provide **Lead Enrichment**, which is part of a paid
service known as **Lead Generation**.

Mail plugins allow you to test Lead Enrichment for free, whether you
connect the plugins to a database or not. After a while, the plugins ask
you to buy `../../essentials/in_app_purchase` credits if you would like
to keep using this service.

### Lead Generation IAP service

Lead Enrichment uses the *Lead Generation IAP service*. Each request
consumes one *Lead Generation credit*.

To buy credits, go to
`Settings --> CRM --> Lead Enrichment --> Buy credits` and select a
package.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you are out of credits, the only information populated when
> clicking on the suggested company is its website link and logo. -
