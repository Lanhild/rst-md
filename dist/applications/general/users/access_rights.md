# Access rights

*Access rights* are permissions that determine the content and
applications users can access and edit. In Konvergo ERP, these permissions can
be set for individual users or for groups of users. Limiting permissions
to only those who need them ensures that users do not modify or delete
anything they should not have access to.

**Only** an *administrator* can change access rights.

</div>

Making changes to access rights can have a detrimental impact on the
database. This includes *impotent admin*, which means that no user in
the database can make changes to the access rights. For this reason,
Konvergo ERP recommends contacting an Konvergo ERP Business Analyst, or our Support
Team, before making changes.

## Users

The access rights for `individual users <users/add-individual>` are set
when the user is added to the database, but they can be adjusted at any
point in the user's profile.

To make changes to a user's rights, click on the desired user to edit
their profile.

<img src="access_rights/navigate-to-users-menu.png" class="align-center"
alt="Users menu in the Users &amp; Companies section of the Settings app of Konvergo ERP." />

On the user's profile page, in the `Access Rights` tab, scroll down to
view the current permissions.

For each app, use the drop-down menu to select what level of permission
this user should have. The options vary for each section, yet the most
common are: `Blank/None`, `User: Own
Documents`, `User: All Documents`, or `Administrator`.

The `Administration` field in the `Access Rights` tab has the following
options: `Settings` or `Access Rights`.

## Create and modify groups

*Groups* are app-specific sets of permissions that are used to manage
common access rights for a large amount of users. Administrators can
modify the existing groups in Konvergo ERP, or create new ones to define rules
for models within an application.

To access groups, first activate Konvergo ERP's
`developer mode <developer-mode>`, then go to
`Settings app --> Users & Companies --> Groups`.

<img src="access_rights/click-users-and-companies.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Groups menu in the Users &amp; Companies section of the Settings app of Konvergo ERP." />

To create a new group from the `Groups` page, click `Create`. Then, from
the blank group form, select an `Application`, and complete the group
form (detailed below).

To modify existing groups, click on an existing group from the list
displayed on the `Groups` page, and edit the contents of the form.

Enter a `Name` for the group and tick the checkbox next to
`Share Group`, if this group was created to set access rights for
sharing data with some users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always test the settings being changed to ensure they are being
> applied to the correct users.

The group form contains multiple tabs for managing all elements of the
group. In each tab, click `Add a line` to add a new row for users or
rules, and click the `‚ùå (remove)` icon to remove a row.

<img src="access_rights/groups-form.png" class="align-center"
alt="Tabs in the Groups form to modify the settings of the group." />

- `Users` tab: lists the current users in the group. Users listed in
  black have administrative rights. Users without administrative access
  appear in blue. Click `Add a
  line` to add users to this group.

- `Inherited` tab: inherited means that users added to this group are
  automatically added to the groups listed on this tab. Click
  `Add a line` to add inherited groups.

  <div class="example">

  For example, if the group *Sales/Administrator* lists the group
  *Website/Restricted Editor* in its `Inherited` tab, then any users
  added to the *Sales/Administrator* group automatically receive access
  to the *Website/Restricted Editor* group, as well.

  </div>

- `Menus` tab: defines which menus/models the group can have access to.
  Click `Add a line` to add a specific menu.

- `Views` tab: lists which views in Konvergo ERP the group has access to. Click
  `Add a
  line` to add a view to the group.

- `Access Rights` tab: lists the first level of rights (models) that
  this group has access rights to. Click `Add a line` to link access
  rights to this group. In this tab, the `Model` column represents the
  common name of the menu/model, and the `Name` column represents the
  technical name given to the model. For each model, enable the
  following options as appropriate:

  - `Read`: users can see the object's existing values.
  - `Write`: users can edit the object's existing values.
  - `Create`: users can create new values for the object.
  - `Delete`: users can delete values for the object.

  > [!TIP]
  > First try searching for the common name of the model in the
  > drop-down menu of the `Model` column. The `Model` technical name can
  > be found by expanding the model common name, which can be done by
  > clicking the `(external link)` icon.
  >
  > The model technical name can also be accessed in
  > `developer mode <developer-mode>`.
  >
  > On a form, navigate to any field, and hover over the field name. A
  > box of backend information reveals itself with the specific Konvergo ERP
  > `Object` name in the backend. This is the technical name of the
  > model that should be added.
  >
  > <img src="access_rights/technical-info.png" class="align-center"
  > alt="Technical information shown on a field of a model, with object highlighted." />

- `Record Rules`: lists the second layer of editing and visibility
  rights. `Record Rules` overwrite, or refine, the group's access
  rights. Click `Add a
  line` to add a record rule to this group. For each rule, choose values
  for the following options:

  - `Apply for Read`.
  - `Apply for Write`.
  - `Apply for Create`.
  - `Apply for Delete`.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Record rules are written using a *domain*, or conditions that filter
  > data. A domain expression is a list of such conditions. For example:
  >
  > <span class="title-ref">\[('mrp_production_ids', 'in',
  > user.partner_id.commercial_partner_id.production_ids.ids)\]</span>
  >
  > This record rule is to enable MRP consumption warnings for
  > subcontractors.
  >
  > Konvergo ERP has a library of preconfigured record rules for ease of use.
  > Users without knowledge of domains (and domain expressions) should
  > consult an Konvergo ERP Business Analyst, or the Konvergo ERP Support Team, before
  > making changes.

## Superuser mode

*Superuser mode* allows the user to bypass record rules and access
rights. To activate *Superuser mode*, first, activate
`developer mode <developer-mode>`. Then, navigate to the *debug* menu,
represented by a `ü™≤ (bug)` icon, located in the top banner.

Finally, towards the bottom of the menu, click `Become Superuser`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only users with *Settings* access for the *Administration* section of
> the *Access Rights* (in their user profile) are allowed to log in to
> *Superuser mode*.

<div class="danger">

<div class="title">

Danger

</div>

*Superuser mode* allows for circumvention of record rules and access
rights, and therefore, should be exercised with extreme caution.

Upon exiting *Superuser mode*, users may be locked out of the database,
due to changes that were made. This can cause *impotent admin*, or an
administrator without the ability to change access rights/settings.

In this case contact Konvergo ERP Support here: [new help
ticket](https://www.odoo.com/help). The support team is able to restore
access using a support login.

</div>

To leave *Superuser mode*, log out of the account, by navigating to the
upper-right corner, and clicking on the `Konvergo ERPBot` username. Then, select
the `Log out` option.

> [!TIP]
> An alternative way to activate *Superuser mode* is to login as a
> superuser. To do that, navigate to the login screen, and enter the
> appropriate `Email` and `Password`.
>
> Instead of clicking `Login`, click `Log in as superuser`.
