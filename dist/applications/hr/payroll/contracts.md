# Contracts

Every employee in Konvergo ERP is required to have a contract in order to be
paid. A contract outlines the terms of an employee's position, their
compensation, working hours, and any other details about their position.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Contract documents (PDFs) are uploaded and organized using the
> *Documents* application, and are signed using the *Sign* application.
> Ensure these applications are installed in order to send and sign
> contracts. Please refer to the `/applications/productivity/documents`
> and `/applications/productivity/sign` documentation.

To view the employee contracts, go to the
`Payroll app --> Contracts --> Contracts` from the top menu. All
employee contracts, and their current contract status, are displayed in
a Kanban view, by default. The Kanban view displays running contracts,
contracts that require action, expired contracts, and cancelled
contracts.

> contracts in the *Employees* application.

## Create a new contract

In order for an employee to be paid, an active contract is required. If
a new contract is needed, click the `Create` button on the `Contracts`
dashboard. A contract form appears where the information can be entered.
Required fields are underlined in bold.

contract, along with specifying which template to use when a new
contract is created. These fields **must** be populated in order to
create a new contract.

Once the edits are complete, click the `Save` button. All the
information for the selected contract template populates the fields in
the `Salary Information` tab. Any additional tabs, such as

### Salary information

This section is where the specific salary details are defined. This
section is country-specific, so these fields vary, depending on where
the company is located.

benefit. Some options that can be entered here include
`Group Insurance Sacrifice Rate` and `Canteen Cost`, for example.

Some fields may be automatically filled in as other fields are entered.
For example, the `Yearly Cost (Real)` and `Monthly Cost (Real)` updates
once the `Wage` is populated.

### Personal documents

This tab **only** appears after an `Employee` is selected, and houses
any documents that are linked to the employee on their employee record.

`fa-download` `(download)` icon next to the document to download it.

Once a contract has been created and/or modified, save the contract by
clicking the `Save` button. Next, the contract must be sent to the
employee to be signed.

  > to the employee, so they can sign it.

Any automatic deductions or allocations for an employee, such as child
support payments and wage garnishments, are referred to as a *salary

allocations are set.

To add a new deduction, first navigate to
`Payroll app --> Contracts --> Salary
Attachments`. Next, click `Create`, and a new salary attachment form
loads.
