to choose from. The `Payroll`, `Meal Vouchers`, `Attachment of Salary`,
and `DMFA` reports are universal and available for all companies
regardless of location. The `Paid Time Off Allocation`, `273S Sheet`,
and `274.XX Sheets` reports are specific to Belgian companies only.

have different default custom filter options. Select the parameters,
then click the `Apply` button.
