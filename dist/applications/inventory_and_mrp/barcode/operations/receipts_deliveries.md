# Process receipts and deliveries with barcodes

<div id="barcode/operations/intro">

The *Barcode* app can be used to process receipts, deliveries, and other
types of operations in real time using a barcode scanner or the Konvergo ERP
mobile app.

</div>

This makes it possible to process operations on the warehouse floor when
they happen, instead of having to wait to validate transfers from a
computer. Processing operations this way can help to properly attribute
barcodes to the appropriate products, pickings, locations, and more.

## Enable Barcode app

To use the *Barcode* app to process transfers, it must be installed by
enabling the feature from the settings of the *Inventory* app.

To do so, go to the `Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`.
Then, scroll down to the `Barcode` section, and click the checkbox next
to the `Barcode Scanner` feature.

Once the checkbox is ticked, click `Save` at the top of the page to save
changes.

Once the page has refreshed, new options will be displayed under the
`Barcode Scanner` feature: `Barcode Nomenclature` (with a corresponding
drop-down menu), where either `Default Nomenclature` or
`Default GS1 Nomenclature` can be selected.

There is also a `Configure Product Barcodes` internal link arrow, and a
set of `Print` buttons for printing barcode commands and a barcode demo
sheet.

For more on setting up and configuring the `Barcode` app, refer to the
`Set up your
barcode scanner <../setup/hardware>` and
`Activate the Barcodes in Konvergo ERP <../setup/software>` documentation pages.

## Scan barcodes for receipts

To process warehouse receipts for incoming products, there first needs
to be a purchase order (PO) created, and a receipt operation to process.

To create a `PO (purchase order)`, navigate to the
`Purchase app --> Create` to create a new request for quotation (RFQ).

From the blank `RFQ (request for quotation)` form, click the drop-down
menu next to the `Vendor` field to add a vendor. Then, on the `Product`
line under the `Products` tab, click `Add a product`, and select the
desired product(s) to add to the quotation.

Once ready, click `Save` at the top of the form, then click
`Confirm Order` to confirm the `RFQ (request for quotation)` to a
`PO (purchase order)`.

To process and scan barcodes for warehouse receipts, navigate to the
`Barcode app`.

Once inside the `Barcode app`, a `Barcode Scanning` screen displaying
different options is presented. To process receipts, click on the
`Operations` button at the bottom of the screen. This navigates to an
`Operations` overview page.

<img src="receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-barcode-scanner.png"
class="align-center" alt="Barcode app start screen with scanner." />

From this page, locate the `Receipts` card, and click the `# To Process`
button to view all outstanding receipts. Then, select the desired
receipt operation to process. This navigates to the barcode transfer
screen.

> [!NOTE]
> If *only* using a barcode scanner or the Konvergo ERP mobile app, the barcodes
> for each transfer of a corresponding operation type can be scanned to
> be processed easily. Once scanned, the products that are part of an
> existing transfer can be scanned, and new products can be added to the
> transfer, as well. Once all products have been scanned, validate the
> transfer to proceed with the stock moves.

From this screen, an overview of all receipts to process within that
transfer (**WH/IN/000XX**) is shown. At the bottom of the screen, there
are options to `Add Product` or `Validate`, depending on if products
need to be added to the operation, or if the whole operation should be
validated at once.

<img src="receipts_deliveries/receipts-deliveries-scanner-overview.png"
class="align-center" alt="Overview of receipts in transfer to scan." />

To process and scan each product individually, choose a specific product
line. The `+#` button (in this case, `+10`) can be clicked to indicate
receipt of that product, or the `pencil` icon can be clicked to open a
new screen to edit that product line.

From this screen, the product that's being received is listed. Under the
product name, the `Quantity` line can be edited. Either change the
<span class="title-ref">0</span> in the line to the desired quantity, or
click the `/# Units` button (in this case, `/10 Units`) to automatically
fill the quantity ordered from the `PO (purchase order)`.

<div class="example">

In the reception operation <span class="title-ref">WH/IN/00019</span>,
<span class="title-ref">10 Units</span> of the
<span class="title-ref">Barcode Product</span> is expected to be
received. <span class="title-ref">\[BARCODE_PROD\]</span> is the
`Internal Reference` set on the product form. Scan the barcode of the
<span class="title-ref">Barcode Product</span> to receive one unit.
Afterwards, click the `pencil` icon to manually enter the received
quantities.

</div>

Additionally, the `+1` and `-1` buttons can be clicked to add or
subtract quantity of the product, and the `number keys` can be used to
add quantity, as well.

Below the `number keys` is the `location` line, which reads
<span class="title-ref">WH/Stock</span> by default, unless another
*location* is listed on the product itself. Click this line to reveal a
drop-down menu of additional locations to choose from.

Once ready, click `Confirm` to confirm the changes made to the product
line.

Then, from the overview page with all receipts to process within that
transfer (**WH/IN/000XX**), click the `+#` button on the product line
for the products being received, and click `Validate`. The receipt has
now been processed, and the `Barcode app` can be closed out.

## Scan barcodes for delivery orders

To process warehouse deliveries for outgoing products, there first needs
to be a sales order (SO) created, and a delivery operation to process.

To create a `SO (sales order)`, navigate to the `Sales app --> Create`
to create a new quotation.

From the blank quotation form, click the drop-down menu next to the
`Customer` field to add a customer. Then, on the `Product` line under
the `Order Lines` tab, click `Add a product`, and select the desired
product(s) to add to the quotation.

Once ready, click `Save` at the top of the form, and click
`Confirm Order` to confirm the quotation to a `SO (sales order)`.

To process and scan barcodes for warehouse deliveries, navigate to the
`Barcode app`.

Once inside the `Barcode app`, a `Barcode Scanning` screen displaying
different options is presented. To process deliveries, click on the
`Operations` button at the bottom of the screen. This navigates to an
`Operations` overview page.

From this page, locate the `Delivery Orders` card, and click the
`# To Process` button to view all outstanding deliveries. Then, select
the desired delivery order to process. This navigates to the barcode
transfer screen.

From this screen, an overview of all deliveries to process within that
transfer (**WH/OUT/000XX**) is shown. At the bottom of the screen, there
are options to `Add Product` or `Validate`, depending on if products
need to be added to the operation, or if the whole operation should be
validated at once.

To process and scan each product individually, choose a specific product
line. The `+1` button can be clicked to indicate delivery of that
product, or the `pencil icon` can be clicked to open a new screen to
edit that product line.

From this screen, the product that's being delivered is listed. Under
the product name, the `Quantity` line can be edited. Either change the
<span class="title-ref">0</span> in the line to the desired quantity, or
click the `/# Units` button (in this case, `/10 Units`) to automatically
fill the quantity ordered from the `SO (sales order)`.

Additionally, the `+1` and `-1` buttons can be clicked to add or
subtract quantity of the product, and the `number keys` can be used to
add quantity, as well.

Below the `number keys` is the `location` line, which reads
<span class="title-ref">WH/Stock</span> by default, unless another
location is listed on the product itself.

This is the location that the product is being pulled from for delivery.
Click this line to reveal a drop-down menu of additional locations to
choose from (if this product is stored in multiple locations in the
warehouse).

> [!TIP]
> For warehouses that have multiple different storage locations, putaway
> rules, and removal strategies, additional steps can be added for
> various operation types, while using the *Barcode* app.

Once ready, click `Confirm` to confirm the changes made to the product
line.

Then, from the overview page with all receipts to process within that
transfer (**WH/OUT/000XX**), click the `+#` button on the product line
for the products being received, and click `Validate`. The delivery has
now been processed, and the *Barcode* app can be closed out.
