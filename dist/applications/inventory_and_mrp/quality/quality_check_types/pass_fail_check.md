# Pass - Fail quality check

In Odoo *Quality*, a *Pass - Fail* check is one of the quality check
types that can be selected when creating a new quality check or quality
control point (QCP). *Pass - Fail* checks consist of a text field that
allows the creator to specify a certain criteria that a product must
meet to pass the check.

## Create a Pass - Fail quality check

There are two distinct ways that *Pass - Fail* quality checks can be
created. A single check can be manually created. Alternatively, a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)` can be configured that automatically
creates checks at a predetermined interval.

This documentation only details the configuration options that are
unique to *Pass - Fail* quality checks and
`QCP (Quality Control Points)`. For a full overview of all the
configuration options available when creating a single check or a
`QCP (Quality Control Point)`, see the documentation on `quality checks
<quality/quality_management/quality-checks>` and `quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

### Quality check

To create a single *Pass - Fail* quality check, navigate to
`Quality --> Quality
Control --> Quality Checks`, and click `New`. Fill out the new quality
check form as follows:

- In the `Type` drop-down field, select the `Pass - Fail` quality check
  type.
- In the `Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for
  managing the check.
- In the `Instructions` text field of the `Notes` tab, enter
  instructions for how to complete the quality check and the criteria
  that must be met for the check to pass.

### Quality Control Point (QCP)

To create a `QCP (Quality Control Point)` that generates *Pass - Fail*
quality checks automatically, begin by navigating to
`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`, and click `New`. Fill
out the new `QCP (Quality Control Point)` form as follows:

- In the `Type` drop-down field, select the `Pass - Fail` quality check
  type.
- In the `Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for
  managing the checks created by the `QCP (Quality Control Point)`.
- In the `Instructions` text field, enter instructions for how to
  complete the quality check and the criteria that must be met for the
  check to pass.

## Process a Pass - Fail quality check

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Measure* quality checks can
be processed. If a quality check is assigned to a specific inventory,
manufacturing, or work order, the check can be processed on the order
itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check's page.

### From the check's page

To process a *Measure* quality check from the check's page, begin by
navigating to `Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, and
select a quality check. Follow the `Instructions` for how to complete
the check.

If the criteria for the check is met, click the `Pass` button at the
top-left corner of the page. If the criteria is not met, click the
`Fail` button.

### On an order

To process a *Pass - Fail* quality check on an order, select a
manufacturing order or inventory order (receipt, delivery, return,
etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, and clicking on
an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to `Inventory`,
clicking the `# To Process` button on an operation card, and selecting
an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple
`Quality Checks` button appears at the top of the order. Click the
button to open the `Quality Check` pop-up window, which shows all of the
quality checks required for that order.

To process a *Pass - Fail* quality check, follow the instructions shown
on the `Quality
Check` pop-up window. If the criteria for the check is met, click the
`Pass` button at the bottom of the window. If the criteria is not met,
click the `Fail` button.

If a quality alert must be created, click the `Quality Alert` button
that appears at the top of the manufacturing or inventory order after
the check fails. Clicking `Quality
Alert` opens a quality alert form on a new page. For a complete guide on
how to fill out quality alert forms, view the documentation on
`quality alerts
<quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.

### On a work order

When configuring a `QCP (Quality Control Point)` that is triggered
during manufacturing, a specific work order can also be specified in the
`Work Order Operation` field on the `QCP (Quality Control Point)` form.
If a work order is specified, a *Pass - Fail* quality check is created
for that specific work order, rather than the manufacturing order as a
whole.

*Pass - Fail* quality checks configured for work orders must be
processed from the tablet view. To do so, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing
Orders`. Select a manufacturing order that includes a work order for
which a quality check is required. Open the tablet view for that work
order by selecting the `Work Orders` tab, and then clicking the
`ðŸ“± (tablet)` button on the order's line.

With tablet view open, complete the steps listed on the left side of the
screen until the *Pass -Fail* quality check step is reached. Upon
reaching the check, follow the instructions that appear at the top of
the screen. If the criteria for the check is met, click the `Pass`
button at the top-right of the screen. If the criteria is not met, click
the `Fail` button.

If a quality alert must be created, do so by clicking the `â˜° (menu)`
button in the tablet view, and selecting `Quality Alert` from the `Menu`
pop-up window. A `Quality Alerts` pop-up window appears, from which a
quality alert can be created. For a complete guide on how to fill out
quality alert forms, view the documentation on `quality
alerts <quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.
