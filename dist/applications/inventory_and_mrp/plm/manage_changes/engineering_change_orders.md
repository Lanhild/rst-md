# Engineering change orders

<div id="plm/eco">

Utilize *engineering change orders* (*ECOs*) to track, implement, and
revert change versions made to products, and
`bills of materials <manufacturing/management/bill-configuration>`.

</div>

Engineering change orders can be created:

1.  `directly in the ECO type <plm/eco/create-eco>`.
2.  by an operator in the `tablet view <plm/eco/tablet-view>` of an
    operation.
3.  automatically from feedback submitted to the
    `ECO type's email alias <plm/eco/eco-type>`.

## Create ECO

To create a new `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`, begin by navigating to
the *PLM* app. Then, select the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` type
card that will be used to track the progress of the change. On the
`Engineering Change Orders` page, click the `New` button in the top-left
corner.

> [!NOTE]
> Learn how to create new `ECO types <plm/eco/eco-type>` to categorize
> and organize change orders. Doing so ensures employees only view the
> `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)` related to their responsibilities,
> whether it involves new product introductions, targeted product line
> updates, or regulatory compliance fulfillment.

On the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` form, fill in the following
fields accordingly:

- `Description` is a brief summary of the improvement.

- `Type`: specifies the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` type project
  for organizing the `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)`.

- `Apply on` determines if the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` changes
  the `Bill of Materials` or the `Product Only`.

- `Product` indicates the product being improved.

- `Bill of Materials` specifies the changed `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.
  It auto-populates if the product in `Product` field has an existing
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`. If multiple `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`
  exist, select the intended radio options from the drop-down menu.

- `Company` field is used in multi-company databases. Specify if the
  change applies to products in a specific company, or leave blank if
  the change applies to all companies.

- `Responsible` represents the assignee in charge of this
  `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`. (Optional)

- `Effective` specifies when the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`
  becomes live. Choosing `As soon as
  possible` means the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` applies to the
  production `BoM (Bill of Materials)` as soon as an authorized user
  `applies the changes <plm/eco/apply-changes>`.

  On the other hand, choosing `At Date`, and setting a specific date,
  leaves a date that makes it easier to track the version history of the
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, and the specific date
  `BoMs (Bills of Materials)`, used for production.

- `Tags` are assigned to `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)` for
  prioritization and organization. Create a new tag by typing the name
  in the field and selecting `Create` from the drop-down menu.
  (Optional)

After filling out the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` form, click the
`Start Revision` button to begin implementing the changes.

By pressing `Start Revision`, three actions occur:

1.  The `Documents` smart button appears, storing relevant files of the
    `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.
2.  A copy of the production `BoM (Bill of Materials)` is stored in the
    newly-appeared `Revision` smart button of the
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`. The next available version number
    (e.g., <span class="title-ref">V2</span>,
    <span class="title-ref">V3</span>, ...) is also assigned to keep
    track of all `BoM (Bill of Materials)` versions.
3.  The stages of the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` `Type` are
    displayed in the top-right corner of the
    `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Revision` smart button is available **only** when the `Bill of
> Materials` radio button is selected in the `Apply on` field, and the
> `Start
> Revision` button has been pressed.

## Change components

To modify the components in a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, click the
`Revision` smart button on an `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` to access
the new version of the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`. Konvergo ERP distinguishes the
non-production version of the `BoM (Bill of Materials)` from the current
version, by flagging the test `BoM (Bill of Materials)` with a large
`Archived` tag.

<div class="example">

After clicking the `Start Revision` button for an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)` for the product,
<span class="title-ref">\[D_0045 Stool\]</span>, make changes to the
product's `BoM (Bill of Materials)` by clicking the `Revision` smart
button. Doing so opens the archived `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, marked
with a large red `Archived` flag.

<img src="engineering_change_orders/archived-bom.png"
class="align-center" alt="Show the archived Bill of Materials." />

</div>

On the new `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, in the `Components` tab, proceed
to modify the components list, by changing the `Quantity` of existing
components, adding new components using the `Add a line` button, and
removing components with the `üóëÔ∏è (trash)` icon.

<div id="plm/eco/example-keyboard">

<div class="example">

In version two of the `BoM (Bill of Materials)` for a keyboard, the
component quantities are reduced, and an additional component,
<span class="title-ref">Stabilizers</span>, is added.

<img src="engineering_change_orders/version-2-bom.png"

</div>

</div>

### Compare changes

Once the changes are complete, navigate back to the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`, by clicking
<span class="title-ref">ECO00X</span> in the breadcrumbs located in the
top-left corner. On the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` form, a new
`BoM Changes` tab displays the differences between the current
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` and the new version.

Blue text indicates new components added to the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` that are not in the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`. Black text represents updates shared by both
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`, while red text indicates components removed
in the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

Changes and tests are encapsulated in the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`, and do **not** affect the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` currently used in production. That is, until
the `changes are applied <plm/eco/apply-changes>`.

<div class="example">

View the summary of the differences between the current and revised
keyboard `BoMs (Bills of Materials)` in the `BoM Changes` tab of the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`.

</div>

## Change operations

To modify the operations in a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, click the
`Revision` smart button on an `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` to access
the archived, new version of the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

In the new `BoM (Bill of Materials)` version, switch to the `Operations`
tab to view and edit `BoM (Bill of Materials)` operations. To make
changes, select each operation, which opens the corresponding `Open:
Operations` pop-up window.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Operations` tab is *not* available by default. To enable it,
> navigate to `Manufacturing app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and
> check the `Work
> Orders` box.

Make changes to any of the fields in the `Open: Operations` pop-up
window, then click `Save` once completed.

Create new operations by clicking the `Add a line` button, and remove
new operations by clicking the `Archive Operation` button.

### Compare changes

Once the changes are complete, navigate back to the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)`, by clicking
<span class="title-ref">ECO00X</span> in the breadcrumbs located in the
top-left corner.

On the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` form, a new `Operation Changes`
tab displays the differences between the current production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` and the new version.

Blue text indicates new operations added to the revised
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` that do not yet exist in the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`. Black text represents updates shared by both
`BoMs (Bills of Materials)`, while red text indicates operations removed
in the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

Modifications to the `BoM (Bill of Materials)` in an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)` will **not** affect the
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` used in production. That is, until the
`changes are applied <plm/eco/apply-changes>`.

In the `Operation Changes` tab, each row of details, beneath the columns
in the table, reflect the following information:

- `Operation`: Name of the operation that was modified.
- `Step`: specifies the quality control point, visible when the
  operation includes detailed instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> To check for instructions, click the operation line item in the
> `Operations` tab of a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`. Then, in the
> `Open: Operations` pop-up window, look for the `Instructions` smart
> button displayed at the top.

<div class="example">

The <span class="title-ref">Assembly</span> `Operation` includes
<span class="title-ref">10</span> detailed `Instructions` to complete
it.

<img src="engineering_change_orders/instructions-smart-button.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Show *Instructions* smart button to check whether an operation has additional
instructions." />

</div>

- `Step Type` details the type of quality control for further
  instructions in the operation.
- `Type` corresponds with the colored text to specify how the revised
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)` differs from the production
  `BoM (Bill of Materials)`. Operation change types can be `Add`,
  `Remove`, or `Update`.
- `Work Center` specifies the work center at which the operation is
  performed.
- `Manual Duration Change` refers to the change in the
  `Default Duration` field in the `Open: Operations` pop-up window,
  which specifies the expected time for completing the operation.

<div class="example">

The `Operation Changes` tab compares the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` with the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)` in
the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`.

In the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, a new
<span class="title-ref">Assembly</span> `Operation` at the `Work Center`
<span class="title-ref">Assembly Line 1</span> is added. In addition,
the expected duration of the operation is
<span class="title-ref">20.00</span> minutes, as specified by the
`Manual Duration Change`.

To supplement the <span class="title-ref">Assembly</span> operation, two
quality control point instructions are added:

1.  The first is the `Step` <span class="title-ref">QCP00039</span>, a
    `Step Type` to `Register
    Production` of components.
2.  The second `Step` is <span class="title-ref">QCP00034</span>, an
    <span class="title-ref">Instructions</span> `Step Type` that
    provides additional assembly details.

</div>

## Apply changes

After verifying the changes, move the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`
to a `verification stage <plm/eco/stage-config>`, which are stages that
require approval before the revised changes can be applied to the
production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

Once the approvers accept the changes, the `Apply Changes` button
becomes available. Click this button, and the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)` is automatically moved to a closing
stage. The changes are applied, which archives the original production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`, and the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`
becomes the new production `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

### Verify changes

To ensure the changes are live, from the
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)` where the `Apply Changes` button was
just pressed, return to the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)` by
clicking the `Revision` smart button.

On the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, the large red `Archived` flag
is removed.

To further verify the changes, check the production
`BoM (Bill of Materials)` by going to `Manufacturing
app --> Products --> Products` and select the product.

Then, on the product form, click the `Bill of Materials` smart button,
and select the `BoM (Bill of Materials)` from the list. In the
`Miscellaneous` tab of the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, the `Version`
field is updated to match the version number shown on the `Revision`
smart button of the latest `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`.

<div class="example">

After applying the changes of the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` for
the `keyboard <plm/eco/example-keyboard>`, view the version of the
current keyboard `BoM (Bill of Materials)` in the `Miscellaneous` tab.
Here, the `Version` number has been updated to
<span class="title-ref">2</span>, matching the
<span class="title-ref">V2</span> that appears in the `Revision` smart
button of the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`.

</div>

## Create ECO from tablet view

Operators can directly suggest clearer operation instructions, while
performing manufacturing orders (MOs) in the *Manufacturing* app.

To create `ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)` in this manner, begin by
navigating to `Manufacturing app -->
Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`. Then, select the desired
`MO (Manufacturing Order)` and switch to the `Work Orders` tab. Then,
click the `üì± (mobile phone)` icon for the desired work order to open
the *tablet view* of the operation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `üì± (mobile phone)` icon is **only** available for
> `MOs (Manufacturing
> Orders)` with a `Confirmed` or `In Progress` status.

<img src="engineering_change_orders/tablet-icon.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Find the tablet icon for each operation, second from the far right." />

Next, add an instructional step, by clicking the
`‚ò∞ (three horizontal lines)` icon in the tablet view of an operation.
Doing so opens the `Menu` of action items for a `MO
(Manufacturing Order)`. Then, click the `Add a step` button.

<img src="engineering_change_orders/additional-options-menu.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Open the *Add a Step* pop-up by clicking the three horizontal lines icon in tablet view." />

Clicking the button reveals an `Add a step` pop-up window, where the
proposed changes are submitted.

In the `Title` field, enter a short step description. Next, in the
`Instruction` text field, type the instructions of the step in greater
detail. Optionally, add an image to the `Document` field. Once
completed, finish by clicking the `Propose Change` button.

<div class="example">

To propose an additional check for broken components, enter the details
in the `Add a
Step` pop-up window. Doing so creates an instructional quality control
point that will be reviewed in the following section.

<img src="engineering_change_orders/add-a-step.png" class="align-center"
alt="Fill out the *Add a Step* form to suggest an additional quality control point." />

</div>

Based on the inputs from the `Add a Step` pop-up window, an
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)` is created with the following
information:

1.  `Description` is the name of the operation, followed by the
    `MO (Manufacturing
    Order)` number for reference.
2.  The `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` `Type` is automatically
    assigned to <span class="title-ref">BOM Changes</span>.
3.  `Product` and `Bill of Materials` fields are automatically
    populated, based on the `BoM (Bill of Materials)` used in the
    `MO (Manufacturing Order)`.
4.  `Responsible` is the operator who submitted the feedback.

### View ECO

To review the proposed changes, navigate to the `PLM app --> Overview`.
In the <span class="title-ref">BOM Updates</span>
`ECO (Engineering Change Order)` type card, the `X Engineering Changes`
button represents the amount of operational changes created from the
tablet view.

Click on the `X Engineering Changes` button to open the kanban view of
the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` type. To view the suggestion,
select an `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` in the
<span class="title-ref">New</span> stage.

On the `ECO (Engineering Change Order)`, view a summary of the proposed
changes in the `Operation Changes` tab. Click the `Revision` smart
button to navigate to the revised `BoM (Bill of Materials)` and look
into the proposed changes in greater detail.

<div class="example">

An operator suggested another check for broken components by adding a
step from the tablet view, while performing the
<span class="title-ref">Assemble switches</span> operation for the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)` <span class="title-ref">WH/MO/00010</span>
for the product, <span class="title-ref">Keyboard</span>.

Then, this created `ECO (Engineering Change Order)` can be viewed by
navigating to the <span class="title-ref">BOM Changes</span> ECO type
found in `PLM app --> Overview`. By default,
`ECOs (Engineering Change Orders)` created from tablet view are set to
spawn in the <span class="title-ref">New</span> stage.

The `Responsible` field is assigned to the operator who made the
suggestion, allowing the employee revising the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`
to seek further clarification from the person who proposed the changes.

class="align-center"
alt="&quot;Show Instructions&quot; icon in the *Operations* tab of a BoM." />

On the
`quality control point <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`
form, ensure the following form fields are accurately filled out to give
detailed instructions for operators:

- `Title`: rename to give a concise description of the new instruction.
- `Control per`: using the drop-down menu, determine whether this
  instruction applies broadly for the `Product`, specifically for this
  `Operation` *only*, or a particular `Quantity` of the product.
- `Type`: categorizes the control point type. From the drop-down menu,
  select `Instructions` to detail an instruction for the worker. To
  receive input from the workers, select the `Take a Picture`,
  `Register Consumed Materials`, `Print Label`, or other
  `quality check options
  <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

<div class="seealso">

`Configure quality control points <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`

</div>

Once the quality control point is configured, return to the `Steps` list
using the breadcrumbs. Finally, drag the last quality control line item
to its intended order of instructions.

<div class="example">

Drag and reorder the <span class="title-ref">Check for broken
switches</span> instruction, by clicking and dragging its "6 dots" icon
to move it from the bottom to the second position.

<img src="engineering_change_orders/reorder.png" class="align-center"
