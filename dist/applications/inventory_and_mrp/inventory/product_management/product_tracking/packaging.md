# Packaging

In Odoo *Inventory*, *packaging* refers to disposable containers holding
multiple units of a specific product. Each specific packaging **must**
be defined on the individual product form.

For example, different packages for cans of soda, such as a 6-pack, a
12-pack, or a case of 36, need to be configured on the individual
product form. This is because packagings are product specific â€” **not**
generic.

## Configuration

To use packagings, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Then, under the
`Products` heading, enable the `Product Packagings` feature, and click
`Save`.

## Create packaging

Packagings can be created directly on the product form, or from the
`Product Packagings` page.

### From product form

Create packagings on a product form by going to
`Inventory app --> Products -->
Products`, and select the desired product.

Under the `Inventory` tab, scroll down to the `Packaging` section, and
click `Add a line`. In the table, fill out the following fields:

- `Packaging` (required): name of packaging that appears on
  sales/purchase orders as a packaging option for the product.
- `Contained quantity` (required): amount of product in the packaging.
- `Unit of Measure` (required): measurement unit for quantifying the
  product.
- `Sales`: check this option for packagings intended for use on sales
  orders.
- `Purchase`: check this option for packagings intended for use on
  purchase orders.

> [!NOTE]
> Access additional fields in the `Packaging` table below by clicking
> the `(sliders)` icon to the far-right of the column titles in the
> `Packaging` section, and selecting the desired options from the
> drop-down menu that appears.

- `Barcode`: identifier for tracing packaging in stock moves or
  pickings, using the `Barcode app <barcode/operations/intro>`. Leave
  blank if not in use.
- `Company`: indicates the packaging is only available at the selected
  company. Leave blank to make the packaging available across all
  companies.

<div class="example">

To create a packaging type for six units of the product,
<span class="title-ref">Grape Soda</span>, begin by clicking
`Add a line`. In the line, name the `Packaging`
<span class="title-ref">6-pack</span>, and set the `Contained quantity`
to <span class="title-ref">6</span>. Repeat this process for additional
packagings.

</div>

### From product packagings page

To view all packagings that have been created, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration
--> Product Packagings`. Doing so reveals the `Product Packagings` page
with a complete list of all packagings that have been created for all
products. Create new packagings by clicking `New`.

<div class="example">

Two soda products, <span class="title-ref">Grape Soda</span> and
<span class="title-ref">Diet Coke</span>, have three types of packagings
configured. On the `Product Packagings` page, each product can be sold
as a <span class="title-ref">6-Pack</span> that contains 6 products, as
a <span class="title-ref">12-Pack</span> of 12 products, or as a
<span class="title-ref">Case</span> of 32 products.

</div>

## Apply packagings

When creating a sales order in the `Sales` app, specify the packagings
that should be used for the product. The chosen packaging is displayed
on the `SO (Sales Order)` under the `Packaging` field.

<div class="example">

18 cans of the product, <span class="title-ref">Grape Soda</span>, is
packed using three 6-pack packagings.

> [!TIP]
> Packaging can be used in conjunction with Odoo
> `Barcode <inventory/barcode/software>`. When receiving products from
> suppliers, scanning the packaging barcode automatically adds the
> number of units in the packaging to the internal count of the product.
