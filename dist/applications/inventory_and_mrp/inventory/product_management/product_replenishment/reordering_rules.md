# Reordering rules

<div id="inventory/management/reordering_rules">

Reordering rules are used to keep forecasted stock levels above a
certain threshold without exceeding a specified upper limit. This is
accomplished by specifying a minimum quantity that stock should not fall
below and a maximum quantity that stock should not exceed.

</div>

Reordering rules can be configured for each product based on the route
used to replenish it. If a product uses the *Buy* route, then a Request
for Quotation (RFQ) is created when the reordering rule is triggered. If
a product uses the *Manufacture* route, then a Manufacturing Order (MO)
is created instead. This is the case regardless of the selected
replenishment route.

## Configure products for reordering rules

In order to use reordering rules for a product, it must first be
correctly configured. Begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`, then select an existing
product, or create a new one by clicking `New`.

On the product form, under the `General Information` tab, make sure that
the `Product Type` is set to `Storable Product`. This is necessary
because Odoo only tracks stock quantities for storable products, and
this number is used to trigger reordering rules.

alt="Set the Product Type as Storable." />

Next, click on the `Inventory` tab and select one or more routes from
the `Routes` section. Doing so tells Odoo which route to use to
replenish the product.

<img src="reordering_rules/select-routes.png" class="align-center"
alt="Select one or more routes on the Inventory tab." />

If the product is reordered using the `Buy` route, confirm that the
`Can be
Purchased` checkbox is enabled under the product name. This makes the
`Purchase` tab appear. Click on the `Purchase` tab, and specify at least
one vendor, and the price that they sell the product for, so that Odoo
knows which company the product should be purchased from.

<img src="reordering_rules/specify-vendor.png" class="align-center"
alt="Specify a vendor and price on the Purchase tab." />

If the product is replenished using the `Manufacture` route, it needs to
have at least one Bill of Materials (BoM) associated with it. This is
necessary because Odoo only creates manufacturing orders for products
with a `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

If a `BoM (Bill of Materials)` does not already exist for the product,
select the `Bill of Materials` smart button at the top of the product
form, then click `New` to configure a new `BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

alt="The Bill of Materials smart button on a product form." />

## Create new reordering rules

To create a new reordering rule, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Reordering Rules`, then click `New`, and fill out the new line as
follows:

- `Product`: The product that is replenished by the rule.
- `Location`: The location where the product is stored.
- `Min Quantity`: The minimum quantity that can be forecasted without
  the rule being triggered. When forecasted stock falls below this
  number, a replenishment order for the product is created.
- `Max Quantity`: The maximum quantity that stock is replenished up to.
- `Multiple Quantity`: Specify if the product should be replenished in
  batches of a certain quantity (e.g., a product could be replenished in
  batches of 20).
- `UoM`: The unit of measure used for reordering the product. This value
  can simply be <span class="title-ref">Units</span> or a specific unit
  of measurement for weight, length, etc.

alt="The form for creating a new reordering rule." />

> [!TIP]
> Reordering rules can also be created from each product form. To do so,
> navigate to `Inventory app --> Products --> Products`, then select a
> product. Click on `Reordering Rules smart button --> New`, then fill
> out the new line, as detailed above.

For advanced usage of reordering rules, learn about the following
reordering rule fields:

- `Trigger <inventory/product_management/trigger>`
- `Visibility days <inventory/product_management/visibility-days>`
- `Preferred route <inventory/product_management/route>`

> [!NOTE]
> The fields above are not available by default, and must be enabled by
> selecting the `(slider)` icon in the far-right corner, and selecting
> the desired column from the drop-down menu.

## Trigger

When stock falls below the reordering rule's minimum, set the reordering
rule's *trigger* to *automatic* to automatically create purchase or
manufacturing orders to replenish stock.

Alternatively, setting the reordering rule's trigger to *manual*
displays the product and forecasted stock on the *replenishment
dashboard*, where the procurement manager can review the stock levels,
lead times, and forecasted dates of arrival.

<div class="seealso">

`strategies`

</div>

> [!TIP]
> The `Replenishment` dashboard is accessible by going to `Inventory app
> --> Operations --> Replenishment`.

To enable the `Trigger` field, go to
`Inventory app --> Configuration -->
Reordering Rules`. Then, click the `(slider)` icon, located to the
far-right of the column titles, and enable the `Trigger` option from the
additional options drop-down menu that appears.

<img src="reordering_rules/enable-trigger.png" class="align-center"
alt="Enable the Trigger field by toggling it in the additional options menu." />

In the `Trigger` column, select `Auto` or `Manual`. Refer to the
sections below to learn about the different types of reordering rules.

### Auto

Automatic reordering rules, enabled by setting the reordering rule's
`Trigger` field to `Auto`, generate purchase or manufacturing orders
when:

1.  the scheduler runs, and the *On Hand* quantity is below the minimum
2.  a sales order is confirmed, and lowers the *Forecasted* quantity of
    the product below the minimum

> [!TIP]
> The scheduler is set to run once a day, by default.
>
> To manually trigger a reordering rule before the scheduler runs,
> ensure `developer mode
> <developer-mode>` is enabled, and then select
> `Inventory app --> Operations -->
> Run Scheduler`. Then, select the green `Run Scheduler` button on the
> pop-up window that appears.
>
> Be aware that this also triggers *any other* scheduled actions.

<div class="example">

The product, <span class="title-ref">Office Lamp</span>, has an
automatic reordering rule set to trigger when the forecasted quantity
falls below the `Min Quantity` of <span class="title-ref">5.00</span>.
Since the current `Forecast` is <span class="title-ref">55.00</span>,
the reordering rule is **not** triggered.

<img src="reordering_rules/auto.png" class="align-center"
alt="Show automatic reordering rule from the Reordering Rule page." />

</div>

If the `Buy` route is selected, then an `RFQ (Request for Quotation)` is
generated. To view and manage `RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`, navigate
to `Purchase app
--> Orders --> Requests for Quotation`.

If the `Manufacture` route is selected, then an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)` is generated. To view and manage
`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`.

When no route is selected, Odoo selects the `Route` specified in the
`Inventory` tab of the product form.

### Manual

Manual reordering rules, configured by setting the reordering rule's
`Trigger` field to `Manual`, list a product on the replenishment
dashboard when the forecasted quantity falls below a specified minimum.
Products on this dashboard are called *needs*, because they are needed
to fulfill upcoming sales orders, for which the forecasted quantity is
not enough.

The replenishment dashboard, accessible by navigating to
`Inventory app -->
Operations --> Replenishment`, considers sales order deadlines,
forecasted stock levels, and vendor lead times. It displays needs
**only** when it is time to reorder items.

> [!NOTE]
> If the one-day window for ordering products is too short, skip to the
> `visibility days
> <inventory/product_management/visibility-days>` section to make the
> need appear on the replenishment dashboard a specified number of days
> in advance.

<img src="reordering_rules/manual.png" class="align-center"
alt="Click the Order Once button on the replenishment dashboard to replenish stock." />

## Visibility days

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure
> `lead times <../../shipping_receiving/advanced_operations_shipping/scheduled_dates>`
> are understood before proceeding with this section.

When `manual reordering rules <inventory/product_management/manual-rr>`
are assigned to a product, *visibility days* make the product appear on
the replenishment dashboard
(`Inventory app --> Operations --> Replenishment`) a certain number of
days in advance.

<div class="example">

A product has a manual reordering rule set to trigger when the stock
level falls below four units. The current on-hand quantity is ten units.

The current date is February twentieth, and the *delivery date* on a
sales order (in the `Other Info` tab) is March third â€” twelve days from
the current date.

The `vendor lead time <inventory/management/purchase-lt>` is four days,
and the
`purchase security lead time <inventory/management/purchase-security-lt>`
is one day.

When the `Visibility Days` field of the reordering rule is set to zero,
the product appears on the replenishment dashboard five days before the
delivery date, which, in this case, is February twenty-seventh.

<img src="reordering_rules/need-dates.png" class="align-center"
alt="Graphic representing when the need appears on the replenishment dashboard: Feb 27." />

To see the product on the replenishment dashboard for the current date,
February twentieth, set the `Visibility Days` to
<span class="title-ref">7.00</span>.

</div>

To determine the number of visibility days needed to see a product on
the replenishment dashboard, subtract *today's date* from the *date the
need appears* on the replenishment dashboard.

$$Visibility~days = Need~appears~date - Today's~date$$

<div class="example">

Referring to the example above, today's date is February twentieth, and
the need for the product appears on February twenty-seventh.

(February 27 - February 20 = 7 days)

Incorrectly setting the `Visibility Days` fewer than seven days in this
case results in the need **not** appearing on the replenishment
dashboard.

<img src="reordering_rules/visibility-days.png" class="align-center"
alt="Show the replenishment dashboard with the correct and incorrect visibility days set." />

</div>

## Preferred route

Odoo allows for multiple routes to be selected under the `Inventory` tab
on each product form. For instance, it is possible to select both `Buy`
and `Manufacture`, thus enabling the functionality of both routes.

Odoo also enables users to set a preferred route for a product's
reordering rule. This is the route that the rule defaults to if multiple
are selected. To select a preferred route, begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Reordering Rules` or
`Inventory app --> Operations --> Replenishment`.

Click inside of the column on the row of a reordering rule, and a
drop-down menu shows all available routes for that rule. Select one to
set it as the preferred route.

<img src="reordering_rules/select-preferred-route.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Select a preferred route from the drop-down." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If multiple routes are enabled for a product but no preferred route is
> set for its reordering rule, the product is reordered using the
> selected route that is listed first on the `Inventory` tab of the
> product form.
