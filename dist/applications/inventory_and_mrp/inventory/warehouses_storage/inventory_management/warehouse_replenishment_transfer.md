# Transfer products between warehouses using replenishment

For companies that use multiple warehouses, it is often necessary to
transfer items between them. This is referred to as an *inter-warehouse
transfer*. Konvergo ERP *Inventory* handles the administrative process of
inter-warehouse transfers to ensure that inventory counts remain
accurate during and after the transfer. This document will detail the
method for conducting an inter-warehouse transfer using replenishment.

## Configure warehouses for inter-warehouse replenishment

First, ensure the `Multi-Step Routes` setting is enabled by navigating
to `Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`, and then check the box
under the `Warehouse` tab. This will provide additional configuration
options when creating a second warehouse that are needed for
inter-warehouse replenishment.

By default, Konvergo ERP comes with a main warehouse already configured. If an
additional warehouse has not already been created, do so now from the
`Inventory` module by selecting
`Configuration --> Warehouses --> Create`. Otherwise, select the
warehouse that products will be transferred to from the `Warehouses`
page and then click `Edit` to change its settings. Configure the
warehouse as follows:

- `Warehouse`: choose a name that is not already being used for another
  warehouse (e.g. <span class="title-ref">Alternative Warehouse</span>)
- `Short Name`: choose a short name by which the warehouse will be
  identified (e.g. <span class="title-ref">ALT_WH</span>)

Click `Save` and the new warehouse will be created. In addition, a new
`Resupply
From` field will appear on the warehouse's form. Click `Edit` and then
check the box next to the warehouse that will be used to resupply the
warehouse that is currently being configured.

> [!NOTE]
> For the purposes of this demonstration, the warehouse that products

> the warehouse that products are transferred to (incoming) will be
> titled "San Francisco 2".

## Configure products for inter-warehouse replenishment

Products must also be configured properly in order for them to be
transferred between warehouses. Navigate to
`Inventory --> Products --> Products` and select an existing product or
`Create` a new one, if necessary.

Then, on the product form, go to the `Inventory` tab and enable the
checkbox for `X: Supply Product from Y`, with *X* being the warehouse
receiving the transferred products and *Y* being the warehouse that
products are transferred from.

## Replenish one warehouse from another

Starting in the `Inventory` module, select `Products --> Products` and
then choose the product that will be replenished. Click the `Replenish`
button on the top left of the product page and fill out the pop-up form
as follows:

- `Quantity`: the number of units that will be sent to the warehouse
  being replenished
- `Scheduled Date`: the date that the replenishment is scheduled to take
  place
- `Warehouse`: the warehouse that will be replenished
- `Preferred Routes`: select <span class="title-ref">X: Supply Product
  from Y</span>, with *X* being the warehouse to be replenished and *Y*
  being the warehouse that the product will be transferred from

Click `Confirm` and a delivery order will be created for the outgoing
warehouse along with a receipt for the warehouse that will receive the
product. Depending on the configuration settings for the outgoing and
incoming warehouses, processing delivery orders and receipts will
require between one and three steps. This document will detail how to
process one-step deliveries and receipts.

### Process the delivery order

The first stage of a replenishment order is processing the delivery from
the warehouse that the product is being transferred from. On the
`Inventory` dashboard, select the `X to Process` button on the
`Delivery Orders` card for the outgoing warehouse, then the delivery
order created for the replenishment. On the delivery order page, click
the `Check Availability` button in the top left to reserve the quantity
of the product to be transferred. Once the delivery has been dispatched,
click the `Validate` button to register the quantities shipped.

### Process the receipt

Once the goods arrive at the incoming warehouse, the receipt created for
that warehouse must be processed as well. Return to the `Inventory`
dashboard and select the `X to
Process` button on the `Receipts` card for the incoming warehouse, then
the receipt created for the replenishment. On the receipt page, click
the `Validate` button in the top left of the page to register the
quantities received.

alt="The delivery orders card for the outgoing warehouse." />

After processing the receipt, the products transferred will now appear
in the inventory of the incoming warehouse. The stock numbers for both
warehouses can be viewed by returning to the product page and selecting
the `X Units On Hand` button at the top of the screen.

## Automate inter-warehouse replenishment

Using reordering rules, it is possible to automate the process of
replenishing one warehouse from another.

To get started, navigate to `Inventory --> Products --> Products`, and
then choose the product that will be replenished. From the product page,
select the `Reordering
Rules` smart button at the top of the form, and then on the next page,
click `Create` to configure the form as follows:

- `Location`: the location that the reordering rule will replenish when
  triggered, in this case, the incoming warehouse
- `Min Quantity`: when the quantity on hand at the incoming warehouse
  falls below this number, the reordering rule will be triggered
- `Max Quantity`: when the reordering rule is triggered, the product
  will be replenished at the incoming warehouse up to this quantity
- `Multiple Quantity`: specify if the product should be replenished in
  batches of a certain quantity; for example, a product could be
  replenished in batches of 20
- `UoM`: the unit of measure used for reordering the product; this value
  can simply be <span class="title-ref">Units</span>, or a specific unit
  of measurement for weight, length, etc.

Finish by clicking `Save` and the reordering rule will be created. Now,
when the scheduler runs automatically each day, a transfer will be
created for each reordering rule that has been triggered.

> [!TIP]
> To manually trigger reordering rules, start from the `Inventory`
> module and select `Operation --> Run Scheduler`, then click the green
> `Run Scheduler` button in the pop-up that appears.

After the scheduler runs, a delivery order and receipt will be created
for the outgoing and incoming warehouses, respectively. Both the
delivery order and receipt should be processed using the same method as
detailed above.
