# Routes and push/pull rules

In inventory management, the supply chain strategy determines when
products should be purchased/manufactured, delivered to distribution
centers, and made available to the retail channel.

In Odoo, a product's supply chain strategy can be configured using
*Routes*, which feature *Pull and Push Rules*. Once everything is
properly configured, the Inventory app can automatically generate
transfers following the configured push/pull rules.

## Inside the warehouse

In a generic warehouse, there are receiving docks, a quality control
area, storage locations, picking and packing areas, and shipping docks.
All products go through all these locations. As the products move
through the locations, each location triggers the products' specified
route and rules.

alt="View of a generic warehouse with stock and quality control area." />

In this example, vendor trucks unload pallets of ordered products at the
receiving docks. Operators then scan the products in the receiving area.
Depending on the product's route and rules, some of these products are
sent to a quality control area (for example, products that are
components used in the manufacturing process), while others are directly
stored in their respective locations.

alt="View of a generic push to rule when receiving products." />

Here is an example of a fulfillment route. In the morning, items are
picked for all the orders that need to be prepared during the day. These
items are picked from storage locations and moved to the picking area,
close to where the orders are packed. Then, the orders are packed in
their respective boxes, and conveyor belts bring them to the shipping
docks, ready to be delivered to customers.

alt="View of a generic pull from rule when preparing deliveries." />

## Pull rules

With *Pull Rules*, a demand for some products triggers procurements,
while *Push Rules* are triggered by products arriving in a specific
location.

Pull Rules are used to fulfill a sales order. Odoo generates a need at
the *Customer Location* for each product in the order. Because pull
rules are triggered by a need, Odoo looks for a pull rule defined on the
*Customer Location*.

In this case, a "delivery order" pull rule that transfers products from
the *Shipping Area* to the *Customer Location* is found, and a transfer
between the two locations is created.

Then, Odoo finds another pull rule that tries to fulfill the need for
the *Shipping Area*: the "packing" rule that transfers products from the
*Packing Area* to the *Shipping Area*. Finally, other pull rules are
triggered until a transfer between the *Stock* and the *Picking Area* is
created.

> [!NOTE]
> All these product transfers are automatically generated by Odoo based
> on the pull rules, starting from the end (the customer location) and
> going backward (the stock warehouse). While working, the operator
> processes these transfers in the opposite order: first the picking,
> then the packing, and finally the delivery order.

## Push rules

On the other hand, *Push Rules* are much easier to understand. Instead
of generating documents based on needs, they are triggered in real time
when products arrive in a specific location. Push rules basically say:
"when a product arrives at a specific location, move it to another
location."

An example of a push rule would be: when a product arrives in the
*Receipt Area*, move it to the *Storage Location*. As different push
rules can be applied to different products, the user can assign
different storage locations for different products.

Another push rule could be: when products arrive at a location, move
them to the *Quality Control Area*. Then, once the quality check is
done, move them to their *Storage Location*.

> [!NOTE]
> Push rules can only be triggered if there are no pull rules that have
> already generated the product transfers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sets of push/pull rules like those are called *Routes*. The grouping
> on the rule decides if products are grouped in the same transfer or
> not. For example, during the picking operation, all orders and their
> products are grouped in one transfer, whereas the packing operation
> respects the grouping per customer order.

## Use routes and rules

Since *Routes* are a collection of *Push and Pull Rules*, Odoo helps you
manage advanced route configurations such as:

- Manage product manufacturing chains.
- Manage default locations per product.
- Define routes within the stock warehouse according to business needs,
  such as quality control, after-sales services, or supplier returns.
- Help rental management by generating automated return moves for rented
  products.

To configure a route for a product, first, open the `Inventory`
application and go to `Configuration --> Settings`. Then, in the
`Warehouse` section, enable the `Multi-Step Routes` feature and click
`Save`.

<img src="use_routes/multi-steps-routes-feature.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Activate the Multi-Step Routes feature in Odoo Inventory." />

> [!NOTE]
> The `Storage Locations` feature is automatically activated with the
> `Multi-Step Routes` feature.

Once this first step is completed, the user can use pre-configured
routes that come with Odoo, or they can create custom routes.

### Pre-configured routes

To access Odoo's pre-configured routes, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Warehouses`. Then, open a warehouse form. In the
`Warehouse Configuration` tab, the user can view the warehouse's
pre-configured routes for `Incoming Shipments` and `Outgoing Shipments`.

<img src="use_routes/example-preconfigured-warehouse.png"
class="align-center"
alt="A pre-configured warehouse in Odoo Inventory." />

Some more advanced routes, such as pick-pack-ship, are also available.
The user can select the route that best fits their business needs. Once
the `Incoming Shipments` and `Outgoing Shipments` routes are set, head
to `Inventory --> Configuration
--> Routes` to see the specific routes that Odoo generated.

<img src="use_routes/preconfigured-routes.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of all the preconfigured routes Odoo offers." />

On the `Routes` page, click on a route to open the route form. In the
route form, the user can view which places the route is `Applicable On`.
The user can also set the route to only apply on a specific `Company`.
This is useful for multi-company environments; for example, a user can
have a company and warehouse in Country A and a second company and
warehouse in Country B.

<img src="use_routes/routes-example.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of a route example applicable on product categories and warehouses." />

At the bottom of the route form, the user can view the specific `Rules`
for the route. Each `Rule` has an `Action`, a `Source Location`, and a
`Destination Location`.

<img src="use_routes/rules-example.png" class="align-center"
alt="An example of rules with push &amp; pull actions in Odoo Inventory." />

### Custom Routes

To create a custom route, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Routes`, and click on `Create`. Next,
choose the places where this route can be selected. A route can be
applicable on a combination of places.

<img src="use_routes/advanced-custom-route.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of a pick-pack-ship route." />

Each place has a different behavior, so it is important to tick only the
useful ones and adapt each route accordingly. Then, configure the
`Rules` of the route.

If the route is applicable on a product category, the route still needs
to be manually set on the product category form by going to
`Inventory --> Configuration --> Product
Categories`. Then, select the product category and open the form. Next,
click `Edit` and under the `Logistics` section, set the `Routes`.

When applying the route on a product category, all the rules configured
in the route are applied to **every** product in the category. This can
be helpful if the business uses the dropshipping process for all the
products from the same category.

<img src="use_routes/routes-logistic-section.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of a route applied to the &quot;all&quot; product category." />

The same behavior applies to the warehouses. If the route can apply to
`Warehouses`, all the transfers occurring inside the chosen warehouse
that meet the conditions of the route's rules will then follow that
route.

<img src="use_routes/applicable-on-warehouse.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the warehouse drop-down menu when selecting applicable on warehouse." />

If the route is applicable on `Sales Order Lines`, it is more or less
the opposite. The route must be manually chosen when creating a
quotation. This is useful if some products go through different routes.

Remember to toggle the visibility of the `Route` column on the
quotation/sales order. Then, the route can be chosen on each line of the
quotation/sales order.

<img src="use_routes/add-routes-to-sales-lines.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the menu allowing to add new lines to sales orders." />

Finally, there are routes that can be applied to products. Those work
more or less like the product categories: once selected, the route must
be manually set on the product form.

To set a route on a product, go to `Inventory --> Products --> Products`
and select the desired product. Then, go to the `Inventory` tab and
under the `Operations` section, select the `Routes`.

<img src="use_routes/on-product-route.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of a product form, where the route must be selected." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rules must be set on the route in order for the route to work.

#### Rules

The rules are defined on the route form. First, go to
`Inventory --> Configuration
--> Routes` and open the desired route form. Next, click `Edit` and in
the `Rules` section, click on `Add a line`.

<img src="use_routes/add-new-rules.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the rules menu, where it is possible to add new rules." />

The available rules trigger various actions. If Odoo offers *Push* and
*Pull* rules, others are also available. Each rule has an `Action`:

- `Pull From`: this rule is triggered by a need for the product in a
  specific location. The need can come from a sales order being
  validated or from a manufacturing order requiring a specific
  component. When the need appears in the destination location, Odoo
  generates a picking to fulfill this need.
- `Push To`: this rule is triggered by the arrival of some products in
  the defined source location. In the case of the user moving products
  to the source location, Odoo generates a picking to move those
  products to the destination location.
- `Pull & Push`: this rule allows the generation of pickings in the two
  situations explained above. This means that when products are required
  at a specific location, a transfer is created from the previous
  location to fulfill that need. This creates a need in the previous
  location and a rule is triggered to fulfill it. Once the second need
  is fulfilled, the products are pushed to the destination location and
  all the needs are fulfilled.
- `Buy`: when products are needed at the destination location, a request
  for quotation is created to fulfill the need.
- `Manufacture`: when products are needed in the source location, a
  manufacturing order is created to fulfill the need.

<img src="use_routes/pull-from-rule-stock-to-packing.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Overview of a &quot;Pull From&quot; rule that creates a transfer between the stock and the packing
zone." />

The `Operation Type` must also be defined on the rule. This defines
which kind of picking is created from the rule.

If the rule's `Action` is set to `Pull From` or `Pull & Push`, a
`Supply Method` must be set. The `Supply Method` defines what happens at
the source location:

- `Take From Stock`: the products are taken from the available stock of
  the source location.
- `Trigger Another Rule`: the system tries to find a stock rule to bring
  the products to the source location. The available stock is ignored.
- `Take From Stock, if Unavailable, Trigger Another Rule`: the products
  are taken from the available stock of the source location. If there is
  no stock available, the system tries to find a rule to bring the
  products to the source location.

## Example flow

In this example, let's use a custom *Pick - Pack - Ship* route to try a
full flow with an advanced custom route.

First, a quick look at the route's rules and their supply methods. There
are three rules, all `Pull From` rules. The `Supply Methods` for each
rule are the following:

- `Take From Stock`: When products are needed in the `WH/Packing Zone`,
  *picks* (internal transfers from `WH/Stock` to `WH/Packing Zone`) are
  created from `WH/Stock` to fulfill the need.
- `Trigger Another Rule`: When products are needed in `WH/Output`,
  *packs* (internal transfers from `WH/Packing Zone` to `WH/Output`) are
  created from `WH/Packing Zone` to fulfill the need.
- `Trigger Another Rule`: When products are needed in `Partner
  Locations/Customers`, *delivery orders* are created from `WH/Output`
  to fulfill the need.

<img src="use_routes/transfers-overview.png" class="align-center"
alt="Overview of all the transfers created by the pick - pack - ship route." />

This means that, when a customer orders products that have a *pick -
pack - ship* route set on it, a delivery order is created to fulfill the
order.

<img src="use_routes/operations-on-transfers.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the operations created by a pull from transfer." />

> [!NOTE]
> If the source document for multiple tranfers is the same sales order,
> the status is not the same. The status will be
> `Waiting Another Operation` if the previous transfer in the list is
> not done yet.

<img src="use_routes/waiting-status.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the transfers&#39; various statuses at the beginning of the process." />

To prepare the delivery order, packed products are needed at the output
area, so an internal transfer is requested from the packing zone.

<img src="use_routes/detailed-operations-2.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the detailed operations for a transfer between the packing and output zones." />

Obviously, the packing zone needs products ready to be packed. So, an
internal transfer is requested to the stock and employees can gather the
required products from the warehouse.

<img src="use_routes/detailed-operations-transfer.png"
class="align-center"
alt="View of the detailed operations for a transfer between the stock and packing zones." />

As explained in the introduction of the documentation, the last step in
the process (for this route, the delivery order) is the first to be
triggered, which then triggers other rules until we reach the first step
in the process (here, the internal transfer from the stock to the
packing area). Now, everything is ready to be processed so the customer
can get the ordered items.

In this example, the product is delivered to the customer when all the
rules have been triggered and the transfers are done.
