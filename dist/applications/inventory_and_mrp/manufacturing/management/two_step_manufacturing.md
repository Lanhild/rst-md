# Two-step manufacturing

Konvergo ERP *Manufacturing* allows users to manufacture products using one,
two, or three steps. When using two-step manufacturing, Konvergo ERP creates a
manufacturing order (MO) and a pick components transfer, but does not
generate a transfer for the movement of finished products into stock.
Inventory counts still update based on the number of products
manufactured, but the act of transferring them to and from inventory is
not tracked.

> [!TIP]
> The number of steps used in manufacturing is set at the warehouse
> level, allowing for each warehouse to use a different number of steps.
> To change the number of steps used for a specific warehouse, begin by
> navigating to `Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`, and then
> select a warehouse from the `Warehouses` screen.
>
> On the `Warehouse Configuration` tab, find the `Manufacture` radio
> input field, and select one of the three options:
> `Manufacture (1 step)`, `Pick
> components and then manufacture (2 steps)`, or
> `Pick components, manufacture and then
> store products (3 steps)`.

## Create manufacturing order

To manufacture a product in Konvergo ERP *Manufacturing*, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, and then click
`New` to create a new `MO (Manufacturing Order)`.

On the new `MO (Manufacturing Order)`, select the product to be produced
from the `Product` drop-down menu. The `Bill of Material` field
auto-populates with the associated Bill of Materials (BoM).

If a product has more than one configured for it, the specific can be
selected in the `Bill of Material` field, and the `Product` field
auto-populates with the associated product.

After a has been selected, the `Components` and `Work Orders` tabs
auto-populate with the components and operations specified on the . If
additional components or operations are required for the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)` being configured, add them to the
`Components` and `Work Orders` tabs by clicking `Add a line`.

Finally, click `Confirm` to confirm the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`.

## Process pick components transfer

After confirming a two-step `MO (Manufacturing Order)`, a `Transfers`
smart button appears at the top of the page. Click it to open the pick
components transfer for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`. This transfer is
used to track the movement of components from the locations where they
are stored to the location where they are used to manufacture the
product.

After transferring the components out of their storage location, click
`Validate` at the top of the transfer, followed by `Apply` on the
`Immediate Transfer?` pop-up window that appears. Doing so marks the
transfer as `Done`, and updates inventory counts to reflect the quantity
of components transferred.

Finally, return to the `MO (Manufacturing Order)` by clicking the
`WH/MO/XXXXX` breadcrumb at the top of the page.

## Process manufacturing order

An `MO (Manufacturing Order)` is processed by completing all of the work
orders listed under its `Work Orders` tab. This can be done on the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)` itself, or from the work order tablet view.

### Basic workflow

To complete work orders from the `MO (Manufacturing Order)` itself,
begin by navigating to `Manufacturing
--> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, and then select an
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`.

On the `MO (Manufacturing Order)` page, select the `Work Orders` tab.
Once work begins on the first work order that needs to be completed,
click the `Start` button for that operation. Konvergo ERP *Manufacturing* then
starts a timer that keeps track of how long the work order takes to
complete.

When the work order is completed, click the `Done` button for that work
order. Repeat the same process for each work order listed on the
`Work Orders` tab.

alt="The Done button for a work order on a manufacturing order." />

After completing all of the work orders, click `Produce All` at the top
of the screen to mark the `MO (Manufacturing Order)` as `Done`, and
register the manufactured product(s) into inventory.

### Tablet view workflow

To complete the work orders for an `MO (Manufacturing Order)` using the
tablet view, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`, and then select
an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`.

Next, click on the `Work Orders` tab, then select the `ðŸ“± (tablet)`
button on the line of the first work order to be processed. This opens
the tablet view.

class="align-center"
alt="The tablet view button for a work order on a manufacturing order." />

After opening the tablet view, Konvergo ERP *Manufacturing* automatically starts
a timer that keeps track of how long the work order takes to complete.
After completing the work order, click the `Mark as Done` button in the
top-right corner of the tablet view.

Clicking `Mark as Done` while there is at least one more work order left
to complete opens a page that lists the next work order. Click on that
work order to open it in the tablet view.

Once the final work order for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)` has been
reached, a `Mark as Done and Close MO` button appears on the tablet view
in addition to the `Mark as Done` button. Click
`Mark as Done and Close MO` to mark the `MO (Manufacturing Order)` as
`Done`, and register the manufactured product(s) into inventory.

It is also possible to complete the final operation while keeping the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)` open, by clicking `Mark as Done`. In this
case, the `MO (Manufacturing Order)` can be closed at a later time by
clicking the `Produce All` button on the order.
