# Work order dependencies

When manufacturing certain products, specific operations may need to be
completed before others can begin. In order to ensure operations are
carried out in the correct order, Konvergo ERP *Manufacturing* features a *work
order dependencies* setting. Enabling this setting allows for operations
on a Bill of Materials (BoM) to be *blocked* by other operations that
should occur first.

## Configuration

The *work order dependencies* setting is not enabled by default. To
enable it, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Configuration --> Settings`. Then, enable the `Work
Orders` setting, if it is not already active.

After enabling the `Work Orders` setting, the `Work Order Dependencies`
setting appears below it. Enable `Work Order Dependencies`, then click
`Save` to confirm the changes.

## Add dependencies to BoM

Work order dependencies are configured on a product's
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`. To do so, navigate to
`Manufacturing --> Products --> Bills of Materials`, then select a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`, or create a new one by clicking `New`.

For a complete guide on how to properly configure a new
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`, see the documentation on
`creating a bill of materials <manufacturing/management/bill-configuration>`.

</div>

On the `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, click on the `Miscellaneous` tab, then
enable the `Operation
Dependencies` checkbox. This makes a new `Blocked By` option available
in the settings of the `Operations` tab.

Next, click on the `Operations` tab. On the top-right of the tab, click
on the tab's `settings` button, then enable the `Blocked By` checkbox.
This makes a `Blocked By` field appear for each operation on the
`Operations` tab.

In the line of the operation that should be blocked by another
operation, click the `Blocked By` field, and an `Open: Operations`
pop-up window appears. In the `Blocked By` drop-down field on the pop-up
window, select the blocking operation that must be completed *before*
the operation that is blocked.

Finally, save the `BoM (Bill of Materials)` by clicking `Save`.

## Plan work orders using dependencies

Once work order dependencies have been configured on a
`BoM (Bill of Materials)`, Konvergo ERP *Manufacturing* is able to plan when
work orders are scheduled, based on their dependencies. To plan the work
orders for a manufacturing order, begin by navigating to
`Manufacturing --> Operations -->
Manufacturing Orders`.

Next, select a manufacturing order for a product with work order
dependencies set on its `BoM (Bill of Materials)`, or create a new
manufacturing order by clicking `New`. If a new manufacturing order is
created, select a `BoM (Bill of Materials)` configured with work order
dependencies from the `Bill of
Material` drop-down field, then click `Confirm`.

After confirming the manufacturing order, select the `Work Orders` tab
to view the work orders required to complete it. Any work orders that
are *not* blocked by a different work order display a
<span class="title-ref">Ready</span> tag in the `Status` section.

Work orders that are blocked by one or more work orders display a
<span class="title-ref">Waiting for another WO</span> tag instead. Once
the blocking work order(s) are completed, the tag updates to
<span class="title-ref">Ready</span>.

class="align-center"
alt="The status tags for work orders on a manufacturing order." />

To schedule the manufacturing order's work orders, click the `Plan`
button at the top of the page. After doing so, the
`Scheduled Start Date` field for each work order on the `Work Orders`
tab auto-fills with the scheduled start date and time. A blocked work
order is scheduled at the end of the time period specified in the
`Expected Duration` field of the work order that precedes it.

alt="The Scheduled Start Date field for work orders on a manufacturing order." />

<div class="example">

A manufacturing order is created for Product A. The manufacturing order
has two operations: Cut and Assemble. Each operation has an expected
duration of 60 minutes, and the Assemble operation is blocked by the Cut
operation.

The `Plan` button for the manufacturing order is clicked at 1:30 pm, and
the Cut operation is scheduled to begin immediately. Since the Cut
operation has an expected duration of 60 minutes, the Assemble operation
is scheduled to begin at 2:30 pm.

### Planning by workcenter

To see a visual representation of how work orders are planned, navigate
to the `Work
Orders Planning` page by going to
`Manufacturing --> Planning --> Planning by
Workcenter`. This page shows a timeline of all the work orders scheduled
for each operation.

If one work order is blocked by the completion of another, the work
order that is blocked is shown as scheduled to start after the work
order blocking it. In addition, an arrow connects the two work orders,
leading from the blocking operation to the blocked operation.
