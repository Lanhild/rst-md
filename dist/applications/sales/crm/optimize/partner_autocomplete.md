# Enrich contacts with partner autocomplete

*Partner autocomplete* enriches the contacts database with corporate
data. In any module, enter the new company name into the `Customer`
field (<span class="title-ref">partner_id</span> technical field), and
select one of the companies suggested in the drop-down menu. Instantly
get valuable company information full of hard-to-find data for a desired
company.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A company **cannot** already be manually entered in the *Contacts*
> application prior to enriching it with data.

The information provided by partner autocomplete can include general
information about the business (including full business name and logo),
social media accounts, `Company type`, `Founded` information, `Sectors`
information, the number of `Employees`, `Estimated revenue`, `Phone`
number, `Timezone`, and `Technologies Used`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When getting a company's contact information make sure to be aware of
> the latest EU regulations. For more information about General Data
> Protection Regulation refer to: [Konvergo ERP GDPR](http://odoo.com/gdpr). In
> Konvergo ERP, individual contact information cannot be searched for with the
> partner autocomplete feature.

## Configuration

Go to `Settings app --> Contacts section`. Then, activate the `Partner

## Enrich contacts with corporate data

From any module, as the user is typing in the name of a new company
contact, Konvergo ERP reveals a large drop-down menu of potential match
suggestions. If any are selected, the contact is then populated with
corporate data related to that specific selection.

For example, after typing <span class="title-ref">Konvergo ERP</span>, the
following information populates:

In the chatter, the following information populates about the company,
after clicking on the desired pre-populated contact:

> [!TIP]
> Partner Autocomplete also works if a `VAT (value-added tax)` number is
> entered instead of company name.
