# Lead enrichment

*Lead enrichment* is a service that provides business information for a
contact attached to a lead. Lead enrichment is an In-App Purchase (IAP)
that requires credits to use, and is available for existing leads in an
Konvergo ERP database.

The information provided by lead enrichment can include general
information about the business (including full business name and logo),
social media accounts, `Company type`, `Founded` information, `Sectors`
information, the number of `Employees`, `Estimated revenue`, `Phone`
number, `Timezone`, and `Technologies Used`.

> [!NOTE]
> Enterprise Konvergo ERP users with a valid subscription get free credits to
> test `IAP (In-App
> Purchase)` features before deciding to purchase more credits for the
> database. This includes demo/training databases, educational
> databases, and one-app-free databases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The *leads* feature **must** be activated in the *CRM* settings page
> in order to use lead enrichment. To access the *CRM* settings,
> navigate to `CRM app --> Configuration
> --> Settings`. Under the `CRM` section activate the `Leads` option and
> click `Save`.

## Lead enrichment set up

To set up lead enrichment in the *CRM* application, navigate to
`CRM app -->
Configuration --> Settings`. Then, under the `Lead Generation` section,
tick the checkbox next to `Lead Enrichment`, and select either
`Enrich leads on demand only` or `Enrich all leads automatically`. Click
the `Save` button to activate the changes.

## Enrich leads

Enrichment of leads is based on the domain of the email address of the
customer set on the lead. There are two different ways that a lead can
be enriched: *automatically* or *manually*.

### Automatically enrich leads

During set up, if `Enrich all leads automatically` was selected on the
*CRM* `Settings` page, then no action needs to be taken by the user to
enrich the lead. A scheduled action runs automatically, every sixty
minutes, and enrichment occurs on leads, after a remote database is
contacted.

> [!TIP]
> To access the cron that runs for the automatic lead enrichment,
> activate `developer mode
> <developer-mode>`, and navigate to
> `Settings app --> Technical menu --> Automation
> section --> Scheduled Actions`. In the `Search...` bar, type in
> <span class="title-ref">CRM</span>. Click into the result labeled
> `CRM: enrich leads (IAP)`, and make any necessary adjustments. In the
> `Execute Every` field, enter a value greater than, or equal to, five
> minutes.

### Manually enrich leads

If the `Enrich leads on demand only` option was selected on the *CRM*
`Settings` page, when activating `Lead Enrichment`, each lead that a
user wishes to enrich **must** be manually enriched. This is achieved by
clicking the `Enrich` button in the top menu of the lead.

The same information will be retrieved at the same
`IAP (In-App Puchase)` credit cost (one per enrichment). This method of
enrichment is useful when every lead does not need to be enriched, or
cost is an issue.

> [!TIP]
> Manually enrich leads in bulk using the *list* view. First, navigate
> to `CRM app
> --> Leads`, and click the list view button
> (`☰ (three horizontal lines)` icon). Next, tick the checkboxes for the
> leads that should be manually enriched. Finally, click the `⚙️ Action`
> icon, and select `Enrich` from the resulting drop-down menu. This can
> also be achieved from the *My Pipeline* page. To do so, simply open
> the *CRM* app, or navigate to `CRM app --> Sales --> My Pipeline`.
> Either route reveals leads and opportunities on the `Pipeline` page.

## Pricing

Lead enrichment is an In-App Purchase (IAP) feature, and each enriched
lead costs one credit.
