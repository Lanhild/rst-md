# Reinvoice expenses to customers

While working on a project for a client, employees often have to spend
their own money on various expenses related to the project.

For example, an employee may need to use their own money to pay for a
hotel, while they provide an on-site service for a client. As a company,
this expense should be reinvoiced to the customer. With Konvergo ERP, these
kinds of expenses can quickly be reinvoiced to the customer related to
the project.

## Expenses application

To be able to reinvoice a customer for an expense, the *Expenses*
application **must** be installed.

To install the *Expenses* application, navigate to
`main Konvergo ERP dashboard --> Apps`, and click `Install` on the *Expenses*
application block. When clicked, Konvergo ERP installs the application,
refreshes the page, and returns to the main Konvergo ERP dashboard.

## Add expenses to sales orders

To begin, have a sales order confirmed in the *Sales* app to which a
reinvoiced expense can be added. Or, create a new sales order from
scratch. To do that, navigate to the `Sales
app --> New`. Doing so reveals a blank quotation form.

Then, add a `Customer`, and add a product to the `Order Lines` tab, by
clicking `Add a product`. Next, select a product from the drop-down
menu.

Lastly, click `Confirm` to confirm the sales order.

With the sales order confirmed, it's time to create an expense.

To do that, navigate to the *Expenses* application, by going to
`main Konvergo ERP dashboard
--> Expenses`.

Then, from the *Expenses* dashboard, click `New` to reveal a blank
expenses form.

<img src="expense/blank-expenses-form.png" class="align-center"
alt="A blank expenses form in the Konvergo ERP Expenses application." />

On the expenses form, add a `Description` to easily reference the
expense.

Then, in the `Category` field, select one of the following options from
the drop-down menu:

- `Communication`: any form of communication related to a project/order.
- `Others`: expense that doesn't fit into any other categories.
- `Meals`: any form of meal costs related to a project/order.
- `Gifts`: any form of gift costs related to a project/order.
- `Mileage`: any form of mileage (gas) costs related to project/order.
- `Travel \& Accommodation`: any travel or accommodation costs related
  to a project/order.

> [!TIP]
> New expense categories can be created from an expense form, by
> clicking the `Category` field drop-down menu, selecting `View All`,
> and clicking `New` from the `Search:Category` pop-up window.

For this sample workflow, which will reinvoice a customer for a brief
hotel stay, the `Category` for this example is
`[TRANS \& ACC] Travel \& Accommodation`.

> [!NOTE]
> The following example requires the *Sales*, *Accounting*, and
> *Expense* apps to view/modify all the fields mentioned during the
> workflow.

Beneath the `Category` field, enter in the amount to be expensed in the
`Total` field.

Next, designate if there are any `Included taxes` in the `Total`. If a
preconfigured tax amount is selected from the `Included taxes` field,
Konvergo ERP auto-calculates the taxed amount, based on the amount entered in
the `Total` field.

Then, choose which `Employee` was responsible for the expense, and
choose an option in the `Paid By` field: `Employee (to reimburse)` or
`Company`.

In this case, our employee paid for the hotel with their own money, so
the `Employee (to
reimburse)` option is chosen.

On the right-hand side of the expenses form, the option to add a
`Bill Reference` is available. Beneath that, the auto-populated
`Expense Date` and `Account` fields are available.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Expense Date` and `Account` field can be modified, if needed.

Next, in the `Customer to Reinvoice` field, click the blank field to
reveal a drop-down menu. From this drop-down menu, select the
appropriate sales order to which this expense should be attached. This
field **must** be filled, in order to reinvoice a customer for an
expense.

Lastly, the option to modify the `Analytic Distribution` and `Company`
fields are available. These fields are *not* required to complete a
reinvoiced expense to a customer, but are available to modify, if
needed.

Also, at the bottom of the expense form, there is a `Notes...` section,
wherein any notes related to this expense can be added, if needed.

<img src="expense/filled-in-expense-form.png" class="align-center"
alt="A filled out expenses form in the Konvergo ERP Expenses application." />

At the top of the expense form, there are buttons to `Attach Receipt`,
`Create
Report`, and `Split Expense`.

If there is a physical or digital receipt that should be attached to the
expense, click `Attach Receipt`.

If the cost of this expense needs to be split, click `Split Expense`.
This feature can be used for a number of reasons (spitting expense with
another employee, to accommodate different tax rates, etc.).

If neither of these options are necessary, click `Create Report` to lock
in the expense report that was just configured.

Doing so reveals an `Expense Report Summary` for the new expense.

<img src="expense/expense-report-summary-form.png" class="align-center"
alt="An expense report summary in the Konvergo ERP Expenses application." />

Here, once the details related to the expense have been confirmed, click
`Submit to
Manager`. This sends the expense report to the approving manager, who
will review the expense.

The manager in charge of reviewing and approving the expense will
inspect the details related to the expense, and if there are no issues,
they will click the `Approve` button â€” which *only* appears on the
manager's view of the `Expense Report Summary` that's been submitted to
the manager by the employee.

<img src="expense/expense-report-summary-manager-approve.png"
class="align-center"
alt="An expense report summary that a manager will approve with an Approve button." />

Once approved, the buttons at the top of the `Expense Report Summary`
change once again. At this point, the buttons at the top of the
`Expense Report Summary` are: `Post
Journal Entries`, `Report in Next Payslip`, `Refuse`, and `Reset to
Draft`.

<img src="expense/expense-report-summary-manager-post-journal.png"
class="align-center"
alt="An expense report summary with post journal entries button at the top of the form." />

When the manager is satisfied with the `Expense Report Summary`, they'll
click `Post Journal Entries`.

Upon clicking `Post Journal Entries`, that button disappears, and the
`Analytic
Distribution` column in the `Expense` tab is filled with the sales order
that was initially configured to the expense in the
`Customer to Reinvoice` field.

## Reinvoice expense

With those steps completed, it's time to return to the sales order to
complete the reinvoice of the expense to the customer.

To do that, navigate to `main Konvergo ERP dashboard --> Sales app`, and select
the appropriate sales order that should be reinvoiced for the expense.

On the sales form, the newly-configured expense is now in the
`Order Lines` tab, with its `Delivered` column filled in, and ready to
be invoiced.

class="align-center"
alt="A sales order with the configured expense ready to be invoiced in the Order Lines tab." />

After confirming the details of the expense, click `Create Invoice` at
the top of the sales order. When clicked, a `Create invoices` pop-up
window appears.

<img src="expense/create-invoices-popup.png" class="align-center"
alt="A create invoices pop-up window that appears when the Create Invoice is clicked." />

From this pop-up window, leave the `Create Invoice` field on the default
`Regular invoice` option, and click `Create Draft Invoice`.

Doing so reveals a `Customer Invoice Draft` showing *only* the expense
in the `Invoice Lines` tab.

<img src="expense/customer-invoice-draft-with-expense.png"
class="align-center"
alt="A customer invoice draft with the expense in the Invoice Lines tab of the form." />

If all the information related to the expense is correct, click
`Confirm` to confirm the invoice. Doing so moves the status of the
invoice from `Draft` to `Posted`.

To send the invoice to the customer, click `Send \& Print`. Doing so
reveals a `Send` pop-up window, with a preconfigured message and PDF
invoice in the body of the message. The message can be reviewed and
modified, if needed.

Once ready, click `Send \& Print` to send the invoice to the customer.
When clicked, the pop-up window disappears, and Konvergo ERP sends the
message/invoice to the customer. Additionally, a PDF of the invoice is
automatically downloaded for record-keeping and/or printing purposes.

Back on the `Customer Invoice`, click the `Register Payment` button when
the customer pays for the invoiced expense.

<img src="expense/customer-invoice-register-payment.png"
class="align-center"
alt="A customer invoice with the register payment button ready to be clicked." />

When `Register Payment` is clicked, a `Register Payment` pop-up window
appears. In this pop-up window, the necessary fields are auto-populated
with the correct information. After reviewing the information, click
`Create Payment`.

<img src="expense/register-payment-popup.png" class="align-center"
alt="A register payment pop-up window on a customer invoice in Konvergo ERP Sales." />

Once `Create Payment` is clicked, the pop-up window disappears, and a
green `In
Payment` banner is in the upper-right corner of the invoice, signifying
this invoice is paid for in full. Thus, completing the workflow.
