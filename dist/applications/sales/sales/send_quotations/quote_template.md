# Quotation templates

In Konvergo ERP *Sales*, salespeople have the ability to create reusable
quotation templates for common products or services that the business
offers.

By using these templates, quotations can be tailored and sent to
customers at a much faster pace, without having to create new quotations
from scratch every time a sales negotiation occurs.

## Configuration

Begin by activating the setting in
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and scroll to the
`Quotations \& Orders` heading.

In that section, check the box beside the `Quotation Templates` option.
Doing so reveals a new `Default Template` field, in which a default
quotation template can be chosen from a drop-down menu.

alt="How to enable quotation templates on Konvergo ERP Sales." />

Also, upon activating the `Quotation Template` feature, an internal `‚û°Ô∏è
Quotation Templates` link appears beneath the `Default Template` field.

Clicking that link reveals the `Quotation Templates` page, from which
templates can be created, viewed, and edited.

Before leaving the `Settings` page, don't forget to click the `Save`
button to save all changes made during the session.

## Create quotation templates

Click the `Quotation Templates` link on the `Settings` page, or navigate
to `Sales app --> Configuration --> Quotation Templates`. Both options
reveal the `Quotation Templates` page, where quotation templates can be
created, viewed, and edited.

<img src="quote_template/quotation-templates-page.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Quotation templates page in the Konvergo ERP Sales application." />

To create a new quotation template, click the `New` button, located in
the upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a blank quotation template form
that can be customized in a number of ways.

<img src="quote_template/blank-quotation-form.png" class="align-center"
alt="Create a new quotation template on Konvergo ERP Sales." />

Start by entering a name for the template in the `Quotation Template`
field.

Then, in the `Quotation expires after` field, designate how many days
the quotation template will remain valid for, or leave the field on the
default <span class="title-ref">0</span> to keep the template valid
indefinitely.

If the `Online Signature` and/or `Online Payment` features are activated
in the `Settings` (`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`), those
options are available in the `Online confirmation` field.

In the `Online confirmation` field, check the box beside `Signature` to
request an online signature from the customer to confirm an order. Check
the box beside `Payment` to request an online payment from the customer
to confirm an order.

Both options can be enabled simultaneously, in which case the customer
must provide **both** a signature **and** a payment to confirm an order.

Next, in the `Confirmation Mail` field, click the blank field to reveal
a drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, select a pre-configured email
template to be sent to customers upon confirmation of an order.

> [!TIP]
> To create a new email template directly from the `Confirmation Mail`
> field, start typing the name of the new email template in the field,
> and select either: `Create` or `Create and edit...` from the drop-down
> menu that appears.
>
> Selecting `Create` creates the email template, which can be edited
> later. Selecting `Create and edit...` creates the email template, and
> a `Create Confirmation
> Mail` pop-up window appears, in which the email template can be
> customized and configured right away.
>

>
> When all modifications are complete, click `Save \& Close` to save the
> email template and return to the quotation form.

If working in a multi-company environment, use the `Company` field to
designate to which company this quotation template applies.

In the `Recurrence` field, choose from a variety of pre-configured
amounts of time (e.g. `Monthly`, `Quarterly`) to designate how often
this quotation template should occur.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Recurrence` field **only** applies to subscription plans. For
> more information, check out the documentation on
> `../../subscriptions/plans`.

### Lines tab

In the `Lines` tab, products can be added to the quotation template by
clicking `Add a product`, organized by clicking `Add a section` (and
dragging/dropping section headers), and further explained with
discretionary information (such as warranty details, terms, etc.) by
clicking `Add a note`.

<img src="quote_template/lines-tab-quotation-template.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Populated lines tab on a quotation template form in Konvergo ERP Sales." />

To add a product to a quotation template, click `Add a product` in the
`Lines` tab of a quotation template form. Doing so reveals a blank field
in the `Product` column.

When clicked, a drop-down menu with existing products in the database
appear. Select the desired product from the drop-down menu to add it to
the quotation template.

> [!TIP]
> If the desired product isn't readily visible, type the name of the
> desired product in the `Product` field, and the option appears in the
> drop-down menu. Products can also be found by clicking
> `Search More...` from the drop-down menu.

> [!NOTE]
> When a product is added to a quotation template, the default
> `Quantity` is <span class="title-ref">1</span>, but that can be edited
> at any time.

Then, drag-and-drop the product to the desired position, via the
`six squares` icon, located to the left of each line item.

To add a *section*, which serves as a header to organize the lines of a
sales order, click `Add a section` in the `Lines` tab. When clicked, a
blank field appears, in which the desired name of the section can be
typed. When the name has been entered, click away to secure the section
name.

Then, drag-and-drop the section name to the desired position, via the
`six squares` icon, located to the left of each line item.

To add a note, which would appear as a piece of text for the customer on
the quotation, click `Add a note` in the `Lines` tab. When clicked, a
blank field appears, in which the desired note can be typed. When the
note has been entered, click away to secure the note.

Then, drag-and-drop the note to the desired position, via the
`six squares` icon.

To delete any line item from the `Lines` tab (product, section, and/or
note), click the `üóëÔ∏è (trash can)` icon on the far-right side of the
line.

### Optional Products tab

The use of *optional products* is a marketing strategy that involves the
cross-selling of products along with a core product. The aim is to offer
useful and related products to customers, which may result in an
increased sale.

For instance, if a customer wants to buy a car, they have the choice to
order massaging seats, as well, or ignore the offer and simply buy the
car. Presenting the choice to purchase optional products enhances the
customer experience.

Optional products appear as a section on the bottom of sales orders and
eCommerce pages. Customers can immediately add them to their online
sales orders themselves, if desired.

<img src="quote_template/optional-products-on-sales-order.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Optional products appearing on a typical sales order with Konvergo ERP Sales." />

In the `Optional Products` tab, `Add a line` for each cross-selling
product related to the original items in the `Lines` tab, if applicable.
The products added here ideally complement the original offering as
added value for the prospective buyer.

<img src="quote_template/optional-products-tab-quotation-template.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Populated optional products tab on a quotation template in Konvergo ERP Sales." />

Clicking `Add a line` reveals a blank field in the `Product` column.

When clicked, a drop-down menu with products from the database appear.
Select the desired product from the drop-down menu to add it as an
optional product to the quotation template.

To delete any line item from the `Optional Products` tab, click the
`üóëÔ∏è (trash
can)` icon.

> [!NOTE]
> Optional products are **not** required to create a quotation template.

### Terms & Conditions tab

The `Terms \& Conditions` tab provides the opportunity to add terms and
conditions to the quotation template. To add terms and conditions,
simply type (or copy/paste) the desired terms and conditions in this
tab.

> [!NOTE]
> Terms and conditions are **not** required to create a quotation

## Design quotation templates

In the upper-left corner of the quotation template form, there's a
`Design Template` button.

<img src="quote_template/design-template-button.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Design template button in the upper-left corner of quotation template form." />

When clicked, Konvergo ERP reveals a preview of the quotation template, through
the Konvergo ERP *Website* application, as it will appear on the front-end of
the website to the customer.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is **only** available if the *Website* application is
> installed.

Konvergo ERP uses numerous blue placeholder blocks to signify where certain
elements appear, and what they contain (e.g. `Template Header`,
`Product`).

To edit the content, appearance, and overall design of the quotation
template via the *Website* application, click the `Edit` button in the
upper-right corner.

<img src="quote_template/design-template-edit-button.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Design template edit button in the upper-right corner of quotation template design." />

When `Edit` is clicked, Konvergo ERP reveals a sidebar filled with a variety of
design elements and feature-rich building blocks. These building blocks
can be dragged-and-dropped anywhere on the quotation template design.

<img src="quote_template/design-quotation-building-blocks.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Design quotation template building blocks sidebar in Konvergo ERP Website." />

After a block has been dropped in the desired position, it can be
customized and configured to fit any unique need, look, or style.

> [!TIP]
> Quotation template design uses the same methodology and functionality
> with design building blocks as a typical web page design with Konvergo ERP
> *Website*. Be sure to check out the `../../../websites/website`
> documentation to learn more.

When all blocks and customizations are complete, click the `Save` button
to put those configurations into place.

There is also a blue banner at the top of the quotation template design
with a link to quickly return `Back to edit mode`. When clicked, Konvergo ERP
returns to the quotation template form in the back-end of the *Sales*
application.

## Use quotation templates

When creating a quotation (`Sales app --> New`), choose a pre-configured
template in the `Quotation Template` field.

top of the page to see how the quotation template appears on the
front-end of the website through Konvergo ERP's customer portal.
