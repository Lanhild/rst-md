# Product variants on quotations and sales orders

Before getting into detail about how to use product variants on
quotations and sales orders, it's recommended to learn about
`../products_prices/products/variants` in Konvergo ERP.

Once familiarized with the basics surrounding product variants, the
following covers how product variants can be added to quotations and
sales orders using the *product configurator* or *order grid entry*.

> [!NOTE]
> It should be noted that the setting is titled, *Variant Grid Entry* on
> the *Sales* app settings page, and titled, *Order Grid Entry* on
> product forms. So, be sure to keep that in mind.

## Settings

When working with product variants, Konvergo ERP uses the product configurator,
by default. To add the variant grid entry option, that feature **must**
be enabled in the Konvergo ERP *Sales* application. The variant grid entry
option provides a pop-up window on the quotation/sales order to simplify
the variant selection process.

To enable that setting, go to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`, and scroll to the
`Product Catalog` section. Then, check the box next to the `Variant Grid
Entry` option, and click `Save`.

> to use product variants on quotations and sales orders.

## Product configuration

Once the `Variant Grid Entry` setting is enabled, both options (*Product
Configurator* and *Order Grid Entry*) become available on every product
form.

To configure a product form to use either a product configurator or
variant grid entry, start by navigating to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products` to view all the products in the
database.

Then, select the desired product to configure, or click `New`, to create
a new product from scratch. Once on the product form, click into the
`Attributes \& Variants` tab, where product variants can be viewed,
modified, and added.

At the bottom of the `Attributes \& Variants` tab, there is a
`Sales Variant
Selection` section with two options: `Product Configurator` and
`Order Grid
Entry`.

> [!NOTE]
> It should be noted that these options **only** appear if at least two
> values of an attribute have been added to the record.

These options determine which method is used when adding product
variants to quotations or sales orders.

The `Product Configurator` provides a pop-up window that neatly displays
all the available product variants for that particular product when it's
added to a quotation. However, only one variant can be selected/added at
a time.

The `Order Grid Entry` provides the same information as the `Product
Configurator` in a table layout, allowing the user to select larger
numbers of unique product variants, and add them to a quotation/sales
order, in a single view.

## Product configurator

The product configurator feature appears as a `Configure` pop-up window,
as soon as a product with (at least two) variants is added to a
quotation or sales order, but **only** if the `Product Configurator`
option is selected on its product form.

> setting is **not** activated, as it is the default option Konvergo ERP uses
> when dealing with product variants on quotations and/or sales orders.

The `Product Configurator` option lets salespeople choose exactly which
product variant to add to the quotation or sales order using a format
similar to online shopping.

## Order grid entry

The order grid entry feature appears as a `Choose Product Variants`
pop-up window, as soon as a product with (at least two) variants is
added to a quotation or sales order, but **only** if the
`Order Grid Entry` option is selected on its product form.

<img src="orders_and_variants/choose-product-variants-popup.png"

The `Choose Product Variants` pop-up window features all the variant
options for that particular product. From this pop-up window, the
salesperson can designate how many of each variant they'd like to add to
the quotation/sales order at once.

When all the desired quantities and variants have been selected, the
salesperson simply clicks `Confirm`, and those orders are instantly
added to the quotation/sales order in the `Order Lines` tab.
