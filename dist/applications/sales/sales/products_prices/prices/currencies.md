# Foreign currencies

With Konvergo ERP, pricelists can be used to manage prices in a number of
foreign currencies. Specifically, Konvergo ERP has the ability to work with 167
total currencies.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to use multiple currencies in Konvergo ERP *Sales*, the *Accounting*
> application **must** be installed.

## Settings

Once the *Accounting* app has been installed, foreign currencies can be
added to the database. Navigate to
`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings`, scroll to the
`Currencies` section, and locate the `Main Currency` setting.

Konvergo ERP automatically sets the main currency as the currency of the country
the company is based in.

To change the main currency of the company, select the drop-down menu in
the `Currency` field, select the desired currency, and be sure to `Save`
the changes.

> [!TIP]
> To ensure currency rates are updated automatically, enable the
> *automatic currency rates* feature on the *Accounting* settings page
> (`Accounting app --> Configuration --> Settings
> --> Currencies section`).

> `Next Run` should be.
>
> To instantly update the currency rates, click the
> `🔁 (circular arrows)` icon, located to the right of the `Next Run`
> field.
>
> When all configurations are complete, be sure to `Save` all changes.

> [!NOTE]
> All payment methods **must** be in the same currency as the sales
> journal, or the company currency, if the company currency is not set.
> If it is not the same, a `Validation
> Error` message appears.

## View, edit, and add currencies

To view, edit, and add currencies to the database, making them available
on pricelists and on the `Main Currency` drop-down menu, click the
`Currencies` link, located beneath the `Currency` field on the
`Accounting app --> Settings` page.

When the `Currencies` link is clicked, a separate `Currencies` page is
revealed.

<img src="currencies/main-currencies-page.png" class="align-center"
alt="How the main currencies page appears in Konvergo ERP Accounting." />

On this page, Konvergo ERP provides a master list of 167 global currencies. Each
row shows the corresponding `Currency`, `Symbol`, `Name`, date of the
`Last Update`, and `Current Rate` (compared to the default currency of
the country in which the company is based).

To the far right, there are two columns, which can be toggled on or off:

- `Use on eBay`: this currency can be used with the connected eBay
  account (if applicable).
- `Active`: this currency is activated, which means it can be added to a
  pricelist, or used as the main currency of the company, if desired
  (via `Accounting app -->
  Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies section`).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all the `Active` currency options are at the top of the
> list.

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended that *at least* one pricelist is created per
> `Active` currency. See `./pricing` to learn more about pricelist
> configuration.

To toggle options on/off, click the toggle switch in the row for the
corresponding column. When *on* the color of the switch is green. When
*off*, the color of the switch is grey.

### Currency detail form

To edit any currency on the `Currencies` page, click the desired
currency to reveal the detail form for that specific currency, and
proceed to make any necessary changes.

<img src="currencies/currency-detail-form.png" class="align-center"
alt="How a currency detail form looks in Konvergo ERP Accounting." />

On the currency detail form, the relevant currency code appears in the
`Currency` field. Beneath that, the name for the currency is in the
`Name` field.

Then, toggle the currency's availability with the `Active` toggle: *on*
is indicated with a green switch, and *off* is indicated with a grey
switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, the appropriate
`Currency Unit` (e.g. <span class="title-ref">Dollars</span>) and
`Currency Subunit` (e.g. <span class="title-ref">Cents</span>) can be
found.

If the currency is meant to be used for eBay purposes, toggle the
`Use on eBay` option to the desired activation.

Next, under the `Rates` tab, the various conversion rates can be viewed,
added, or deleted. Each row shows the `Date` of that specific rate, the
`Company` to which it is connected, followed by the `Unit per...` and
`...per Unit`.

> [!NOTE]
> The *...* in each of the last two columns represents the main currency
> set for the company. For example, if the main currency is set to
> <span class="title-ref">USD</span>, the columns are titled
> `Unit per USD` and `USD per Unit`.

To add a new rate, click `Add a line` in the `Rates` tab, and proceed to
fill in the necessary information in the aforementioned columns.

### Main currency detail form

If the selected currency is the main currency of the company, a blue
banner appears at the top of the currency detail form with the message:
`This is your company's currency.`.

<img src="currencies/main-currency-detail-form.png" class="align-center"
alt="How a main currency detail form looks in Konvergo ERP Accounting." />

All the fields are the same as a typical currency detail form, but there
will **not** be a `Rates` tab because all other currency rates are based
off the main currency of the company.

## Create new currency

If a desired currency isn't on the `Currencies` page, click the `New`
button to open a blank currency template form.

> [!TIP]
> The same `New` button is located in the upper-right corner of any
> currency detail form.

<img src="currencies/blank-currency-detail-form.png"
class="align-center"
alt="How a blank currency detail form looks in Konvergo ERP Accounting." />

On the blank currency detail form, proceed to enter the desired currency
code in the `Currency` field. Beneath that, enter the name for the
currency in the `Name` field.

Then, toggle the currency's availability with the `Active` toggle
switch.

On the right of the currency detail form, enter the appropriate
`Currency Unit` (e.g. <span class="title-ref">Dollars</span>) and
appropriate `Currency Subunit` (e.g.
<span class="title-ref">Cents</span>).

If the currency is meant to be used for eBay purposes, toggle the
`Use on eBay` to the desired activation.

Next, under the `Rates` tab, add a new rate by clicking `Add a line`.
Then, proceed to confirm and adjust the `Date`, `Company`,
`Unit per...`, and `...per Unit` fields to ensure all the auto-populated
information is accurate.

> [!NOTE]
> The *...* in each of the last two columns represents the main currency
> set for the company. For example, if the main currency is set to
> <span class="title-ref">USD</span>, the columns are titled
> `Unit per USD` and `USD per Unit`.

## Currency-specific pricelists

It is recommended that *at least* one pricelist is created per active
currency in the database. To create (or assign) a pricelist to a
specific currency, start by navigating to `Sales
app --> Products --> Pricelists`.

From the `Pricelists` page, either select an existing pricelist to edit,
or click `New` to create a new pricelist.

On the pricelist detail form, for either a new or existing pricelist,
adjust the `Currency` field as desired.

## Auto-conversion from public price

It should be noted that the public price seen on products is directly
related to the main currency the company has set, which is configured by
navigating to `Accounting app -->
Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies section --> Main Currency --> Currency drop-down menu`.

The sales price automatically updates if the pricelist is changed to a
different pricelist that has a different currency than the company's
main currency. The change in price is directly related to the updated
conversion rate for that currency.

## Set product prices

In order to have product prices set in place to avoid any changes in
currency rates, start by navigating to
`Sales app --> Products --> Products`.

From the `Products` page, select the desired product to modify. Or,
create a new product by clicking the `New` button.

Then, on the product detail form, click the `Extra Prices` smart button,
located in the upper-left corner. Doing so reveals a separate
`Price Rules` page, specific to that particular product.

<img src="currencies/price-rules-currencies.png" class="align-center"
alt="How to set product prices based on foreign currency pricelists in Konvergo ERP Sales." />

Click `New`, and select the desired pricelist from the drop-down menu in
the `Pricelist` column.

The `Applied On` field is auto-populated with the product, so proceed to
enter in the desired figures in the `Min. Quantity` and `Price` fields.

> [!NOTE]
> The figure in the `Min. Quantity` field means the `Price` being set
> will **only** trigger if at least that amount of product is purchased.

If necessary, configure a `Start Date` and `End Date` for the set
prices. Leaving those columns blank ensures the set price will remain
valid, regardless of the date of sale.

If working in a multi-company environment, designate to which company
this price rule should be applied in the `Company` field. Leaving that
field blank ensures the price rule applies to all companies in the
database.

With those configurations complete, regardless of any changes/updates in
conversion, whenever those designated pricelists are applied to a
customer trying to purchase this specific product, these pre-determined
set prices appear.
