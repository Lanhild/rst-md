# Ship later

The **Ship Later** feature allows you to sell products and schedule
delivery at a later date. It is useful, for example, when a product is
out of stock or so voluminous that it requires to be shipped, or if, for
any reason, the customer needs their order to be shipped later, etc.

## Configuration

`Go to the POS settings <configuration/settings>`, scroll down to the
`Inventory` section, and enable `Allow Ship Later`.

Once activated, you can:

- Choose the location from where the products are shipped by selecting a
  `Warehouse`.
- Define a `Specific route`, or leave this field empty to use the
  default route.
- Define the `Shipping Policy`; select `As soon as possible` if the
  products can be delivered separately or `When all products are ready`
  to ship all the products at once.

</div>

## Practical application

1.  `Open a session <pos/session-start>` and make a sale.
2.  On the payment screen, set a customer and select `Ship Later`.
3.  On the popup window, set a shipping date and click `Confirm` to
    proceed to payment.

The system instantly creates a delivery order from the warehouse to the
shipping address.
