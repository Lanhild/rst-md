# Views

Views are the interface that allows displaying the data contained in a
model. One model can have several views, which are simply different ways
to show the same data. In Studio, views are organized into four
categories: `general <studio/views/general>`, `multiple records
<studio/views/multiple-records>`, `timeline <studio/views/timeline>`,
and `reporting
<studio/views/reporting>`.

> [!TIP]
> To change the default view of a model, go to
> `Studio --> Views --> Dropdown menu
> (â‹®) --> Set as Default`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can modify views by using the built-in XML editor. To do so,
> activate `Developer mode
> <developer-mode>`, go to the view you want to edit, select the `View`
> tab and then click on `</> XML`.
>
> > [!IMPORTANT]
> > If you are editing a view using the XML editor, avoid making changes
> > directly to standard views and inherited views, as those would be
> > reset and would not be kept in case of an update or module upgrade.
> > Always make sure you select the right Studio inherited views.
> > Indeed, when you modify a view in Studio by drag-and-dropping a new
> > field, a specific Studio inherited view and its XPath, the latter
> > which defines which part of the view is modified, are automatically
> > generated.

## General views

> [!NOTE]
> The settings described below are found under the view's `View` tab
> unless specified otherwise.

### Form

The `Form` view is used when creating and editing records, such as
contacts, sales orders, products, etc.

- To structure a form, drag-and-drop the `Tabs and Columns` element
  found under the `+ Add` tab.
- To prevent users from creating, editing, or deleting records, untick
  `Can Create`, `Can Edit`, or `Can Delete`.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/form-sales-order.png" class="align-center"
alt="Sales order model&#39;s Form view" />

</div>

### Activity

The `Activity` view is used to schedule and have an overview of
activities (emails, calls, etc.) linked to records.

> [!NOTE]
> This view can only be modified within Studio by editing the XML code.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/activity-lead-opportunity.png" class="align-center"
alt="Lead/Opportunity model&#39;s Activity view" />

</div>

### Search

The `Search` view is added on top of other views to filter, group, and
search records.

- To add custom `Filters` and structure them using `Separators`, go to
  the `+ Add` tab and drag and drop them under `Filters`.
- To add an existing field under the search dropdown menu, go to the
  `+ Add` tab and drag-and-drop it under `Autocompletion Fields`.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/search-project-kanban.png" class="align-center"
alt="Project model&#39;s Search view on the Kanban view" />

</div>

## Multiple records views

> [!NOTE]
> The settings described below are found under the view's `View` tab
> unless specified otherwise.

### Kanban

The `Kanban` view is often used to support business flows by moving
records across stages or as an alternative way to display records inside
*cards*.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `Kanban` view exists, it is used by default to display data on
> mobile devices instead of the
> `List view <studio/views/multiple-records/list>`.

- To prevent users from creating new records, untick `Can Create`.
- To create records directly within the view, in a minimalistic form,
  enable `Quick
  Create`.
- To change the way records are grouped by default, select a new group
  under `Default
  Group by`.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/kanban-project.png" class="align-center"
alt="Project model&#39;s Kanban view" />

</div>

### List

The `List` view is used to overview many records at once, look for
records, and edit simple records.

- To prevent users from creating, editing, or deleting records, untick
  `Can Create`, `Can Edit`, or `Can Delete`.

- To create and edit records directly within the view, select either
  `New record on top` or `New record at the bottom` under `Editable`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This prevents users from opening records in
  > `Form view <studio/views/general/form>` from the `List` view.

- To edit several records at once, tick `Enable Mass Editing`.

- To change the way records are sorted by default, select a field under
  `Sort By`.

> [!TIP]
> To add a drag handle icon to reorder records manually, add an
> `Integer field
> <studio/fields/simple-fields/integer>` with the `Handle` widget.
>

<div class="example">

<img src="views/list-sales-order.png" class="align-center"
alt="Sales order model&#39;s List view" />

</div>

### Map

The `Map` view is used to display records on a map. For example, it is
used in the Field Service app to plan an itinerary between different
tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> A `Many2One field <studio/fields/relational-fields/many2one>` linked
> to the *Contact* model is required to activate the view, as the
> contact address is used to position records on the map.

- To select which kind of contact should be used on the map, select it
  under `Contact
  Field`.
- To hide the name or the address of the record, tick `Hide name` or
  `Hide
  Address`.
- To add information from other fields, select them under
  `Additional Fields`.
- To have a route suggested between the different records, tick
  `Enable Routing` and select which field should be used to sort records
  for the routing.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/map-task.png" class="align-center"
alt="Task model&#39;s Map view" />

</div>

## Timeline views

> [!NOTE]
> - When you first activate one of the timeline views, you need to
> select which `Date
> <studio/fields/simple-fields/date>` or `Date & Time
> <studio/fields/simple-fields/date-time>` fields on your model should
> be used to define when the records start and stop in order to display
> them on the view. You can modify the `Start Date Field` and
> `Stop Date Field` after activating the view. - The settings described
> below are found under the view's `View` tab unless specified
> otherwise.

### Calendar

The `Calendar` view is used to overview and manage records inside a
calendar.

- To create records directly within the view instead of opening the
  `Form view
  <studio/views/general/form>`, enable `Quick Create`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This only works on specific models that can be *quick-created* using
  > only a *name*. However, most models do not support quick creation
  > and open the `Form` view to fill in the required fields.

- To color records on the calendar, select a field under `Color`. All
  the records sharing the same value for that field are displayed using
  the same color.

  > [!NOTE]
  > As the number of colors is limited, the same color can end up being
  > assigned to different values.

- To display events lasting the whole day at the top of the calendar,
  select a `Checkbox field
  <studio/fields/simple-fields/checkbox>` that specifies if the event
  lasts the whole day.

- To choose the default time scale used to display events, select `Day`,
  `Week`, `Month`, or `Year` under `Default Display Mode`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use `Delay Field` to display the duration of the event in
> hours by selecting a `Decimal <studio/fields/simple-fields/decimal>`
> or `Integer
> <studio/fields/simple-fields/integer>` field on the model which
> specifies the duration of the event. However, if you set an
> `End Date Field`, the `Delay Field` will not be taken into account.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/calendar-event.png" class="align-center"
alt="Calendar Event model&#39;s Calendar view" />

</div>

### Cohort

The `Cohort` view is used to examine the life cycle of records over a
time period. For example, it is used in the Subscriptions app to view
the subscriptions' retention rate.

- To display a measure (i.e., the aggregated value of a given field) by
  default on the view, select a `Measure Field`.
- To choose which time interval is used by default to group results,
  select `Day`, `Week`, `Month`, or `Year` under `Interval`.
- To change the cohort `Mode`, select either `Retention` `the percentage
  of records staying over a period of time, it starts at 100% and decreases with time`
  or `Churn`
  `the percentage of records moving out over a period of time - it starts at
  0% and increases with time`.
- To change the way the `Timeline` (i.e., the columns) progresses,
  select either `Forward` (from 0 to +15) or `Backward` (from -15 to 0).
  For most purposes, the `Forward` timeline is used.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/cohort-subscription.png" class="align-center"
alt="Subscription model&#39;s Cohort view" />

</div>

### Gantt

The `Gantt` view is used to forecast and examine the overall progress of
records. Records are represented by a bar under a time scale.

- To prevent users from creating or editing records, untick `Can Create`
  or `Can
  Edit`.

- To fill cells in gray whenever a record should not be created there
  (e.g., on weekends for employees), tick `Display Unavailability`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The underlying model must support this feature, and support for it
  > cannot be added using Studio. It is supported for the Project, Time
  > Off, Planning, and Manufacturing apps.

- To show a total row at the bottom, tick `Display Total row`.

- To collapse multiple records in a single row, tick
  `Collapse First Level`.

- To choose which way records are grouped by default on rows (e.g., per
  employee or project), select a field under `Default Group by`.

- To define a default time scale to view records, select `Day`, `Week`,
  `Month`, or `Year` under `Default Scale`.

- To color records on the view, select a field under `Color`. All the
  records sharing the same value for that field are displayed using the
  same color.

  > [!NOTE]
  > As the number of colors is limited, the same color can be assigned
  > to different values.

- To specify with which degree of precision each time scale should be
  divided by, select `Quarter Hour`, `Half Hour`, or `Hour` under `Day
  Precision`, `Half Day` or `Day` under `Week Precision`, and
  `Month Precision`.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/gantt-planning.png" class="align-center"
alt="Planning Shift model&#39;s Gantt view" />

</div>

## Reporting views

> [!NOTE]
> The settings described below are found under the view's `View` tab
> unless specified otherwise.

### Pivot

The `Pivot` view is used to explore and analyze the data contained in
records in an interactive manner. It is especially useful to aggregate
numeric data, create categories, and drill down the data by expanding
and collapsing different levels of data.

- To access all records whose data is aggregated under a cell, tick
  `Access records from
  cell`.
- To divide the data into different categories, select field(s) under
  `Column grouping`, `Row grouping - First level`, or
  `Row grouping - Second level`.
- To add different types of data to be measured using the view, select a
  field under `Measures`.
- To display a count of records that made up the aggregated data in a
  cell, tick `Display
  count`.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/pivot-purchase-report.png" class="align-center"
alt="Purchase Report model&#39;s Pivot view" />

</div>

### Graph

The `Graph` view is used to showcase data from records in a bar, line,
or pie chart.

- To change the default chart, select `Bar`, `Line`, or `Pie` under
  `Type`.
- To choose a default data dimension (category), select a field under
  `First dimension` and, if needed, another under `Second dimension`.
- To select a default type of data to be measured using the view, select
  a field under `Measure`.
- *For Bar and Line charts only*: To sort the different data categories
  by their value, select `Ascending` (from lowest to highest value) or
  `Descending` (from highest to lowest) under `Sorting`.
- *For Bar and Pie charts only*: To access all records whose data is
  aggregated under a data category on the chart, tick
  `Access records from graph`.
- *For Bar charts only*: When using two data dimensions (categories),
  display the two columns on top of each other by default by ticking
  `Stacked graph`.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/graph-sales-report.png" class="align-center"
alt="Sales Analysis Report model&#39;s Bar chart on Graph view" />

</div>

### Dashboard

The `Dashboard` view is used to display multiple reporting views and key
performance indicators. Which elements are displayed on the view depends
on the configuration of the other reporting views.

<div class="example">

<img src="views/dashboard-sales-report.png" class="align-center"
alt="Sales Analysis Report model&#39;s Dashboard view" />

</div>
