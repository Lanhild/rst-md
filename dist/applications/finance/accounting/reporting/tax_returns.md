# Tax return (VAT declaration)

Companies with a registered `VAT (Value Added Tax)` number must submit a
**tax return** on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on their
turnover and the registration regulation. A tax return - or VAT return -
gives the tax authorities information about the taxable transactions
made by the company. The **output tax** is charged on the number of
goods and services sold by a business, while the **input tax** is the
tax added to the price when goods or services are purchased. Based on
these values, the company can calculate the tax amount they have to pay
or be refunded.

> You can find additional information about VAT and its mechanism on
> this page from the European Commission: ["What is
> VAT?"](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/what-is-vat_en).

## Prerequisites

### Tax Return Periodicity

The configuration of the **Tax Return Periodicity** allows Konvergo ERP to
compute your tax return correctly and also to send you a reminder to
never miss a tax return deadline.

To do so, go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under the
`Tax Return Periodicity`, you can set:

- `Periodicity`: define here whether you submit your tax return on a
  monthly or quarterly basis;
- `Reminder`: define when Konvergo ERP should remind you to submit your tax
  return;
- `Journal`: select the journal in which to record the tax return.

> [!NOTE]
> This is usually configured during the
> `app's initial set up <../get_started>`.

### Tax Grids

Konvergo ERP generates tax reports based on the `Tax Grids` settings that are
configured on your taxes. Therefore, it is crucial to make sure that all
recorded transactions use the right taxes. You can see the `Tax Grids`
by opening the `Journal Items` tab of any invoice and bill.

To configure your tax grids, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`, and open the tax you want to
modify. There, you can edit your tax settings, along with the tax grids
that are used to record invoices or credit notes.

> <fiscal_localizations/packages>` is installed according to the country
> you select at the creation of your database.

## Close a tax period

### Tax Lock Date

Any new transaction whose accounting date prior to the `Tax Lock Date`
has its tax values moved to the next open tax period. This is useful to
make sure that no change can be made to a report once its period is
closed.

Therefore, we recommend locking your tax date before working on your
`Closing Journal Entry`. This way, other users cannot modify or add
transactions that would have an impact on the `Closing Journal Entry`,
which can help you avoid some tax declaration errors.

To check the current `Tax Lock Date`, or to edit it, go to
`Accounting --> Accounting --> Actions: Lock Dates`.

### Tax Report

Once all the transactions involving taxes have been posted for the
period you want to report, open your `Tax Report` by going to
`Accounting --> Reporting -->
Audit Reports: Tax Report`. Make sure to select the right period you
want to declare by using the date filter, this way you can have an
overview of your tax report. From this view, you can easily access
different formats of your tax report, such as
<span class="title-ref">PDF</span> and XLSX. These include all the
values to report to the tax authorities, along with the amount you have
to pay or be refunded.

> [!NOTE]
> If you forgot to lock your tax date before clicking on
> `Closing Journal Entry`, then Konvergo ERP automatically locks your fiscal
> period on the same date as the accounting date of your entry. This
> safety mechanism can prevent some fiscal errors, but it is advised to
> lock your tax date manually before, as described above.
