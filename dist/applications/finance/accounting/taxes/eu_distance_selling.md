# EU intra-community distance selling

EU intra-community distance selling involves the cross-border trade of
goods and services from vendors registered for VAT purposes to
individuals (B2C) located in a European Union member state. The
transaction is conducted remotely, typically through online platforms,
mail orders, telephone, or other means of communication.

EU intra-community distance selling is subject to specific VAT rules and
regulations. The vendor must charge VAT per the VAT rate applicable in
the buyer's country.

> [!NOTE]
> This remains applicable even if the vendor is located outside of the
> European Union.

## Configuration

The **EU Intra-community Distance Selling** feature helps you comply
with this regulation by creating and configuring new **fiscal
positions** and **taxes** based on your company's country. To enable it,
go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Taxes`, tick
`EU Intra-community Distance Selling`, and `Save`.

## One-Stop Shop (OSS)

The `OSS (One-Stop Shop)` system introduced by the European Union
simplifies VAT collection for **cross-border** sales of goods and
services. It primarily applies to business-to-consumer **(B2C)** cases.
With the OSS, businesses can register for VAT in their home country and
use a single online portal to handle VAT obligations for their sales
within the EU. There are **two primary schemes**: the **Union OSS**
scheme for cross-border services and the **Import OSS** scheme for goods
valued at or below €150.

### Reports

To generate **OSS sales** or **OSS imports** reports and submit them
onto the OSS portal, go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> Tax Report`,
click `Report: Generic Tax
report`, and select either `OSS Sales` or `OSS Imports`. Once selected,
click on `PDF`, `XLSX`, or `XML` in the top-left corner. This generates
the currently-opened report in the selected format. Once generated, log
into the platform of your competent federal authority to submit it onto
the OSS portal.
