# AI-powered document digitization

**Invoice digitization** is the process of converting paper documents
into vendor bill and customer invoice forms in your accounting.

Konvergo ERP uses `OCR (optical character recognition)` and artificial
intelligence technologies to recognize the content of the documents.
Vendor bill and customer invoice forms are automatically created and
populated based on the scanned invoices.

## Configuration

In `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Digitization`, check
the box `Document Digitization` and choose whether `Vendor Bills` and
`Customer Invoices` (this includes customer credit notes) should be
processed automatically or on demand.

If you enable the `Single Invoice Line Per Tax` option, only one line is
created per tax in the new bill, regardless of the number of lines on
the invoice.

## Invoice upload

### Upload invoices manually

From the `Accounting Dashboard`, click on the `Upload` button of your
vendor bills journal. Alternatively, go to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices` or
`Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills` and select `Upload`.

### Upload invoices using an email alias

You can configure your connected scanner to send scanned documents to an
email alias. Emails sent to these aliases are converted into new draft
customer invoices or vendor bills.

You can modify the email alias of a journal. To do so, go to the
`Settings` app. Under `General Settings: Discuss`, enable
`Custom Email Servers`, add an `Alias Domain`, and `Save`.

The email alias is now available in the `Advanced Settings` tab of the
journal. Emails sent to this address will be converted automatically
into new invoices or bills.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the `Documents </applications/productivity/documents>` app,
> you can automatically send your scanned invoices to the `Finance`
> workspace (e.g.,
> <span class="title-ref">inbox-financial@example.odoo.com</span>).

The default email aliases <span class="title-ref">vendor-bills@</span>
and <span class="title-ref">customer-invoices@</span> followed by the
`Alias Domain` you set are automatically created for the `Vendor Bills`
and `Customer Invoices` journals, respectively. Emails sent to these
addresses are converted automatically into new invoices or bills.

To change a default email alias, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Journals`. Select the
journal you want to edit, click on the `Advanced Settings` tab, and edit
the <span class="title-ref">Email Alias</span>.

## Invoice digitization

According to your settings, the document is either processed
automatically, or you need to click on `Send for digitization` to do it
manually.

Once the data is extracted from the PDF, you can correct it if necessary
by clicking on the respective tags (available in `Edit` mode) and
selecting the proper information instead.

## Data recognition with AI

It is essential to review and correct (if needed) the information
uploaded during digitization. Then, you have to post the document by
clicking on `Confirm`. In this manner, the AI learns, and the system
identifies the correct data for future digitizations.

## Pricing

The **invoice digitization** is an In-App Purchase (IAP) service that
requires prepaid credits to work. Digitizing one document consumes one
credit.

To buy credits, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Digitization` and click
on `Buy credits`, or go to `Settings --> Konvergo ERP IAP` and click on
`View My Services`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are on Konvergo ERP Online and have the Enterprise version, you benefit
> from free trial credits to test the feature.
