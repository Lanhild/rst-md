# Batch payments by bank deposit

A **batch deposit** is a convenient way to group customer payments and
deposit them into your bank account. The feature lets you list multiple
payments and generate a detailed deposit slip with a batch reference.
This reference can be used when reconciling to match bank statement
lines with transactions in the batch deposit.

## Configuration

Go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Customer Payments`
and tick `Batch Payments` to activate the feature.

### Register payments

Before performing a batch deposit, it is necessary to register each
transaction's payment. To do so, open the corresponding customer invoice
and click `Register Payment`. In the pop-up window, select the `Journal`
linked to your bank account and `Batch Deposit` as the `Payment Method`,
and click `Create Payment`.

### Bank reconciliation

Once the bank transactions are on your database, you can reconcile bank
statement lines with the batch payment. To do so, go to the
`Accounting Dashboard` and click `Reconcile
Items` on the related bank account. Go to the `Batch Payments` tab to
select a specific batch and click `Validate` to finalize the process.
