# Follow-up on invoices

A follow-up message can be sent to customers when a payment is overdue.
Konvergo ERP helps you identify late payments and allows you to schedule and
send the appropriate reminders using **follow-up actions** that
automatically trigger one or more actions according to the number of
overdue days. You can send your follow-ups via different means, such as
email, post, or SMS.

## Configuration

To configure a `Follow-Up Action`, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Follow-up Levels`, and select or create (a) new follow-up level(s).
Several follow-up actions are available by default under the
`Notification` tab, and the **name** as well as the **number of days**
can be changed. The follow-up `Actions` available are:

- `Send Email`;
- `Send a Letter <customer_invoices/snailmail>`;
- `Send an SMS message <pricing/pricing_and_faq>`.

You can use a pre-filled template for your messages by selecting a
`Content Template`. To change the template used, hover over the field
and click the `-->`. If enabled, SMS messages have a specific
`Sms Template` field.

It is possible to automatically send a reminder by enabling the
`Automatic` option, and attaching the *open* invoice(s) by enabling
`Attach Invoices`, within a specific follow-up action.

By clicking on the `Activity` tab, scheduling activities (tasks) is
possible. That way, an activity is automatically scheduled when the
follow-up is triggered. To do so, enable `Schedule Activity`, and select
a `Responsible` person for the task. Choose an `Activity Type`, and
enter a `Summary` on how to handle the activity, if desired.

> [!TIP]
> Set a negative number of days to send a reminder before the actual due
> date.

## Follow-up reports

Overdue invoices you need to follow up on are available in
`Accounting --> Customers
--> Follow-up Reports`. By default, Konvergo ERP filters by `Overdue Invoices`,
but you can also filter by `In need of action` in the `Filters` menu.

When selecting an invoice, you can see all of the customer's unpaid
invoices (overdue or not), with the due dates of late invoices appearing
in red. You can exclude invoices from a reminder by clicking
`Exclude from Follow-ups`. You can set either `Automatic` or `Manual`
reminders as well as a `Responsible` person for that customer.

To send reminders, click on `Follow up`, and select the action(s) you
want to perform from:

- `Print`;
- `Email`;
- `Sms`;
- `By post`.

You can `Attach Invoices` and change the content templates from this
view. When done, click `Send` or `Send & Print`.

> [!NOTE]
> - The contact information on the invoice or the contact form is used
> to send the reminder. - When the reminder is sent, it is documented in
> the chatter of the invoice. - If it is not the right time for a
> reminder, you can specify the `Next Reminder` date. You will get the
> next report according to the next reminder date set.

> [!TIP]
> Reconcile all bank statements right before launching the follow-up
> process to avoid sending a reminder to a customer that has already
> paid.

### Debtor's trust level

To know whether a customer usually pays late or not, you can set a trust
level by marking them as `Good Debtor`, `Normal Debtor`, or `Bad Debtor`
on their follow-up report. To do so, click on the bullet next to the
customer's name and select a trust level.

### Send reminders in batches

You can send reminder emails in batches from the `Follow-up Reports`
page. To do so, select all the reports you would like to process, click
on the `Action` gear icon, and select `Process follow-ups`.
