# Bank reconciliation

**Bank reconciliation** is the process of matching your
`bank transactions <transactions>` with your business records, such as
`customer invoices <../customer_invoices>`, `vendor bills
<../vendor_bills>`, and `payments <../payments>`. Not only is this
compulsory for most businesses, but it also offers several benefits,
such as reduced risk of errors in financial reports, detection of
fraudulent activities, and improved cash flow management.

Thanks to the bank `reconciliation models <reconciliation_models>`, Konvergo ERP
pre-selects the matching entries automatically.

## Bank reconciliation view

To access a bank journal's **reconciliation view**, go to your
`Accounting Dashboard` and either:

- click the journal name (e.g., `Bank`) to display all transactions,
  including those previously reconciled or
- click the `Reconcile items` button to display all transactions Konvergo ERP
  pre-selected for reconciliation. You can remove the `Not Matched`
  filter from the search bar to include previously reconciled
  transactions.

The bank reconciliation view is structured into three distinct sections:
transactions, counterpart entries, and resulting entry.

Transactions  
The transactions section on the left shows all bank transactions, with
the newest displayed first. Click a transaction to select it.

Counterpart entries  
The counterpart entries section on the bottom right displays the options
to match the selected bank transaction. Multiple tabs are available,
including `reconciliation/existing-entries`,
`reconciliation/batch-payments`, `reconciliation/manual-operations`, and
`Discuss`, which contains the chatter for the selected bank transaction.

Resulting entry  
The resulting entry section on the top right displays the selected bank
transaction matched with the counterpart entries and includes any
remaining debits or credits. In this section, you can validate the
reconciliation or mark it as `To Check`. Any `reconciliation model
buttons <reconciliation/button>` are also available in the resulting
entry section.

## Reconcile transactions

Transactions can be matched automatically with the use of
`reconciliation models
<reconciliation_models>`, or they can be matched with `existing entries
<reconciliation/existing-entries>`,
`batch payments <reconciliation/batch-payments>`,
`manual operations <reconciliation/manual-operations>`, and
`reconciliation model buttons
<reconciliation/button>`.

1.  Select a transaction among unmatched bank transactions.
2.  Define the counterpart. There are several options for defining a
    counterpart, including
    `matching existing entries <reconciliation/existing-entries>`,
    `manual operations
    <reconciliation/manual-operations>`,
    `batch payments <reconciliation/batch-payments>`, and
    `reconciliation model buttons <reconciliation/button>`.
3.  If the resulting entry isn't fully balanced, balance it by adding
    another existing counterpart entry or writing it off with a
    `manual operation <reconciliation/manual-operations>`.
4.  Click the `Validate` button to confirm the reconciliation and move
    to the next transaction.

> [!TIP]
> If you aren't sure how to reconcile a particular transaction and would
> like to deal with it later, use the `To Check` button instead. All
> transactions marked as `To
> Check` can be displayed using the `To Check` filter.

> [!NOTE]
> Bank transactions are posted on the **journal's suspense account**
> until reconciliation. At this point, reconciliation modifies the
> transaction journal entry by replacing the bank suspense account with
> the corresponding receivable, payable, or outstanding account.

### Match existing entries

This tab contains matching entries Konvergo ERP automatically pre-selects
according to the reconciliation models. The entry order is based on
`reconciliation models <reconciliation_models>`, with suggested entries
appearing first.

> [!TIP]
> The search bar within the `Match Existing Entries` tab allows you to
> search for specific journal items.

### Batch payments

[Batch payments](payments/batch-payments) allow you to group different
payments to ease reconciliation. Use the `Batch Payments` tab to find
batch payments for customers and vendors. Similarly to the
`Match Existing Entries` tab, the `Batch Payments` tab has a search bar
that allows you to search for specific batch payments.

### Manual operations

If there isn't an existing entry to match the selected transaction, you
may instead wish to reconcile the transaction manually by choosing the
correct account and amount. Then, complete any of the relevant optional
fields.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `fully paid` option to reconcile a payment, even in
> cases where only a partial payment is received. A new line appears in
> the resulting entry section to reflect the open balance registered on
> the Account Receivable by default. You can choose another account by
> clicking on the new line in the resulting entry section and selecting
> the `Account` to record the open balance.

### Reconciliation model buttons

Use a `reconciliation model <reconciliation_models>` button for manual
operations that are frequently used. These custom buttons allow you to
quickly reconcile bank transactions manually and can also be used in
combination with existing entries.
