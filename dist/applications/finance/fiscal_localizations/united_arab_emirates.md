## Taxes

To access your taxes, go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`.
Activate/deactivate, or
`configure </applications/finance/accounting/taxes/>` the taxes relevant
to your business by clicking on them. Remember to only set tax accounts
on the **5%** tax group, as other groups do not need closing. To do so,
enable the `developer mode
<../../general/developer_mode>` and go to
`Configuration --> Tax Groups`. Then, set a
`Tax current account (payable)`, `Tax current account (receivable)`, and
an `Advance Tax payment account` for the **5%** group.

> [!NOTE]
> The `RCM (Reverse Charge Mechanism)` is supported by Konvergo ERP.

## Currency exchange rates

To update the currency exchange rates, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Currencies`. Click on the update button (`🗘`) found next to
the `Next Run` field.

To launch the update automatically at set intervals, change the
`Interval` from `Manually` to the desired frequency.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the UAE Central Bank exchange rates web service is used.
> Several other providers are available under the `Service` field.

## Payroll

The `UAE - Payroll` module creates the necessary **salary rules** in the
Payroll app in compliance with the UAE rules and regulations. The salary
rules are linked to the corresponding accounts in the **chart of
accounts**.

class="align-center" alt="The UAE Employee Payroll Structure." />

### Salary rules

To apply these rules to an employee's contract, go to
`Payroll --> Contracts -->
Contracts` and select the employee's contract. In the
`Salary Structure Type` field, select `UAE Employee`.

<img src="united_arab_emirates/uae-localization-salary-structure.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Select the Salary Structure Type to apply to the contract." />

Under the `Salary Information` tab, you can find details such as the:

- `Wage`;
- `Housing Allowance`;
- `Transportation Allowance`;
- `Other Allowances`;
- `Number of Days`: used to calculate the `end of service provision
  <uae-end-of-service-provision>`.

> [!NOTE]
> - **Leave deductions** are calculated using a salary rule linked to
> the **unpaid leave** time-off type; - Any other deductions or
> reimbursements are made *manually* using other inputs; - **Overtimes**
> are added *manually* by going to `Work Entries --> Work Entries`; -
> **Salary attachments** are generated by going to `Contracts -->
> Salary Attachments`. Then, `Create` an attachment and select the
> `Employee` and the
> `Type (Attachment of Salary, Assignment of Salary, Child Support)`.

> [!TIP]
> To prevent a rule from appearing on a paycheck, go to
> `Payroll --> Configuration
> --> Rules`. Click on `UAE Employee Payroll Structure`, select the rule
> to hide, and uncheck `Appears on Payslip`.

### End of service provision

The provision is defined as the total monthly allowance *divided* by 30
and then *multiplied* by the number of days set in the field
`Number of days` at the bottom of a contract's form.

The provision is then calculated via a salary rule associated with two
accounts: the **End Of Service Indemnity (Expense account)** and the
**End of Service Provision (Non-current Liabilities account)**. The
latter is used to pay off the **end of service amount** by settling it
with the **payables account**.

> [!NOTE]
> The end of service amount is calculated based on the gross salary and
> the start and end dates of the employee’s contract.

### Invoices

The UAE localization package allows the generation of invoices in
English, Arabic, or both. The localization also includes a line to
display the **VAT amount** per line.
