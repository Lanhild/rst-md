## Annual tax report

You can generate an XML file to electronically file your annual tax
report with the tax office.

To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Report --> Luxembourg --> Annual Tax Report`, click on
`Create`, then define the annual period in the `Year` field.

The **simplified annual declaration** is automatically generated. You
can manually add values in all the fields to get a **complete annual
declaration**.

To help you complete it, you can use the information provided on the
`Tax Report`. To do so, go to
`Accounting --> Report --> Audit Reports --> Tax Report`, then click on
the `Tax Report` dropdown menu and select the type of report you want to
display.

## FAIA (SAF-T)

**FAIA (Fichier d’Audit Informatisé AED)** is a standardized and
structured file that facilitates the exchange of information between the
taxpayers' accounting system and the tax office. It is the Luxembourgish
version of the OECD-recommended SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax).

Konvergo ERP can generate an XML file that contains all the content of an
accounting period according to the rules imposed by the Luxembourg tax
authorities on digital audit files.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires the module `Luxembourg - Accounting Reports` to
> be installed.

### Export FAIA file

Go to `Accounting --> Reporting --> Audit Reports -->  General Ledger`,
then click on `FAIA`.
