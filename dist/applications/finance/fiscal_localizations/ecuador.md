localization module, the accounts are mapped automatically in Taxes,
Default Account Payable, Default Account Receivable.

The chart of accounts for Ecuador is based on the most updated version
of Superintendency of Companies, which is grouped in several categories
and is compatible with NIIF accounting.

You can add or delete accounts according to the company's needs.

#### Products

In addition to the basic information in your products, you must add the
configuration of the withholding code (tax) that applies.

Go to `Accounting --> Vendors:  Products` under the tab "Purchase"

<img src="ecuador/products.png" class="align-center"

#### Review your taxes

As part of the localization module, taxes are automatically created with
its configuration and related financial accounts.

<img src="ecuador/taxes.png" class="align-center"
alt="Taxes for Ecuador." />

The following options have been automatically configured:

- `Tax Support`: to be configured only in the IVA tax, this option is
  useful when you register purchase withholdings.
- `Code ATS`: to be configured only for income tax withholding codes, it
  is important when you register the withholding.
- `Tax Grids`: configure the codes of 104 form if it is a IVA tax and
  configure the codes of 103 form if it is a income tax withholding
  code.
- `Tax Name`:
  - For IVA tax, format the name as: <span class="title-ref">IVA
    \[percent\] (104, \[form code\] \[tax support code\] \[tax support
    short name\])</span>
  - For income tax withholding code, format the name as:
    <span class="title-ref">Code ATS \[Percent of withhold\] \[withhold
    name\]</span>

Once the Ecuador module is installed, the most common taxes are
automatically configured. If you need to create an additional one, you
can do so, for which you must base yourself on the configuration of the
existing taxes.

#### Review your Document Types

Some accounting transactions like *Customer Invoices* and *Vendor Bills*
are classified by document types. These are defined by the government
fiscal authorities, in this case by the SRI.

Each document type can have a unique sequence per journal where it is
assigned. As part of the localization, the document type includes the
country on which the document is applicable; also the data is created
automatically when the localization module is installed.

The information required for the document types is included by default
so the user does not need to fill anything there.
