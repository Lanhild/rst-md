## Webinars

A video on the Mexican localization is also available. This video covers
how to implement this localization from scratch, including how to set up
the configurations, how to complete common workflows, and provides an
in-depth look at several specific use cases, as well.

- [Video webinar of a complete
  demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cdogjm0GCI).

## Introduction

The Konvergo ERP Mexican localization modules allow for the signing of
electronic invoices, according to the specifications of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` for [version 4.0 of the
CFDI \<http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/
tramitesyservicios/Paginas/documentos/Anexo_20_Guia_de_llenado_CFDI.pdf\>](),
a legal requirement, as of January 1, 2022. These modules also add
relevant accounting reports (such as: the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`, enables
foreign trade, and the creation of delivery guides).

> [!NOTE]
> In order to electronically sign any documents in Konvergo ERP, ensure the
> *Sign* application is installed.

## Configuration

### Requirements

It is necessary to meet the following requirements before configuring
the Mexican localization modules in Konvergo ERP:

<div id="mx-requirements">

1.  Be registered in the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`,
    with a valid `RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`.
2.  Have a [Certificate of Digital Seal
    \<https://www.gob.mx/sat/acciones-y-programas/
    certificado-de-sello-digital\>]() (CSD).
3.  Choose a PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized
    Certification Provider). Currently, Konvergo ERP works with the following
    `PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
    Provider)`s: [Solución Factible](https://solucionfactible.com/),
    [Quadrum (formerly Finkok)](https://cfdiquadrum.com.mx/) and [SW
    Sapien - Smarter Web](https://sw.com.mx/).
4.  Have knowledge and experience with billing, sales, and accounting in
    Konvergo ERP. This documentation **only** contains the necessary information
    needed to use Konvergo ERP.

</div>

### Installing modules

`Install <general/install>` the following modules to get all the
features of the Mexican localization. The `Accounting <../accounting>`
and *Contacts* modules are required to be installed for this
configuration:

| Name                                         | Technical name                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

> [!NOTE]
> When installing a database from scratch and selecting `Mexico` as the
> country, Konvergo ERP automatically installs the following modules:
> `Mexico - Accounting`, `EDI for
> Mexico`, and `EDI v4.0 for Mexico`.

The following modules are optional. It's recommended to install them
*only* if meeting a specific requirement. Make sure that they are needed
for the business.

### Configure your company

After installing the correct modules, the next step is to verify that
your company is configured with the correct data. To do so, go to
`Settings --> General Settings --> Companies`, and select `Update Info`
under your company name.

Enter the full `Address` in the resulting form, including: `ZIP` code,
`State`, `Country`, and `RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`
(`VAT` number).

According to the requirements of the CFDI 4.0, the name of the main
company contact **must** coincide with your business name registered in
the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`, without the legal
entity abbreviation.

<img src="mexico/mx-company-info.png" class="align-center"
alt="Main company contact requirements for a correct invoicing." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> From a legal point of view, a Mexican company **must** use the local
> currency (MXN). Therefore, Konvergo ERP does not provide features to manage an
> alternative configuration. If you want to manage another currency, let
> MXN be the default currency and use a `pricelist
> <../../sales/sales/products_prices/prices/pricing>`, instead.

Next, go to
`Settings --> Accounting --> Electronic Invoicing (MX) --> Fiscal
Regime`, then select the regime that applies to your company from the
drop-down list, and click `Save`.

<img src="mexico/mx-fiscal-regime.png" class="align-center"
alt="Fiscal regime configuration in the Accounting settings." />

> [!TIP]
> If you want to test the Mexican localization, the company can be
> configured with a real address within Mexico (including all fields),
> and add <span class="title-ref">EKU9003173C9</span> as the `VAT` and
> <span class="title-ref">ESCUELA KEMPER URGATE</span> as the
> `Company Name`. For the `Fiscal Regime`, use
> `General de Ley Personas Morales`.

### Contacts

To create a contact that can be invoiced, go to `Contacts --> Create`.
Then, enter the contact name, full `Address` including: `ZIP` code,
`State`, `Country`, and `RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)`
(`VAT` number).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As with your own company, all of your contacts needs to have their
> correct business name registered in the
> `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`. This also applies to
> the `Fiscal Regime`, which needs to be added in the `MX EDI` tab.

### Taxes

Some additional configurations for factor type and tax objects need to
be added to the sales taxes in order to properly sign invoices.

#### Factor type

The *Factor Type* field is pre-loaded in the default taxes. If new taxes
are created, you need to make sure to configure this field. To do so, go
to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Taxes`, then enable the `Factor Type` field in the `Advanced Options`
tab for all records, with the `Tax Type` set as `Sales`.

<img src="mexico/mx-factor-type.png" class="align-center"
alt="Factor Type Sales tax type configuration." />

> [!TIP]
> Mexico manages two different kinds of 0% VAT to accommodate two
> scenarios:
>
> - *0% VAT* set the `Factor Type` as `Tasa`
> - *VAT Exempt* set the `Factor Type` as `Exento`

#### Tax object

One requirement of the CFDI 4.0 is that the resulting XML file needs (or
does not need) to break down the taxes of the operation. There are three
different possible values that are added in the XML file:

- \`01\`: Not subject to tax - this value is added automatically if your
  invoice line doesn't contain any taxes.
- \`02\`: Subject to tax - this is the default configuration of any
  invoice line that contains taxes.
- \`03\`: Subject to tax and not forced to break down - this value can
  be triggered on-demand for certain customers to replace the value 02.

To use the <span class="title-ref">03</span> value, navigate to
`Contacts --> your customer's invoice --> MX EDI
tab`, and activate the `No Tax Breakdown` checkbox.

<img src="mexico/mx-tax-breakdown.png" class="align-center"
alt="No Tax Breakdown option on the MX EDI tab of the customer&#39;s invoice." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `No Tax Breakdown` value applies **only** to specific fiscal
> regimes and/or taxes. Consult your accountant first to see if it is
> needed for your business before making any modification.

#### Other tax configurations

When registering a payment, Konvergo ERP will carry out the movement of taxes
from the *Cash Basis Transition Account* to the account set in the
`Definition` tab. For such movement, a tax base account will be used:
(<span class="title-ref">Base Imponible de Impuestos en Base a Flujo de
Efectivo</span>) in the journal entry when reclassifying taxes. **Do not
delete this account**.

If you create a new tax in `Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes`, you
need to add the correct `Tax Grids` for it
(<span class="title-ref">IVA</span>, <span class="title-ref">ISR</span>
or <span class="title-ref">IEPS</span>). Konvergo ERP **only** supports these
three groups of taxes.

<img src="mexico/mx-taxes-config.png" class="align-center"
alt="Tax accounts available for Konvergo ERP." />

### Products

To configure products, go to `Accounting --> Customers --> Products`,
then select a product to configure, or `Create` a new one. In the
`Accounting` tab, and in the `UNSPSC Product Category` field, select the
category that represents the product. The process can be done manually,
or through `a bulk import <../../essentials/export_import_data>`.

> [!NOTE]
> All products need to have an
> `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` code associated with
> them in order to prevent validation errors.

### Electronic invoicing

#### PAC credentials

After you have processed your [Private Key (CSD)
\<https://www.sat.gob.mx/aplicacion/16660/genera-y-descarga-tus-archivos-a-traves-de-la-aplicacion-
certifica\>]() with the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`,
you **must** register directly with the `PAC <mx-requirements>` of your
choice before you start creating invoices from Konvergo ERP.

Once you've created your account with any of these providers, go to
`Settings -->
Accounting --> Electronic Invoicing (MX)`. Under the `MX PAC` section,
enter the name of your
`PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
Provider)` with your credentials (`PAC username` and `PAC password`).

<img src="mexico/mx-pac-account.png" class="align-center"
alt="Configuring PAC credentials from the Accounting settings." />

> [!TIP]
> If you do not have credentials, but want to test the electronic
> invoicing, you can activate the `MX PAC test environment` checkbox,
> and select `Solucion Factible` as the
> `PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
> Provider)`. You do not need to add a username or password for a test
> environment.

#### .cer and .key certificates

The [digital certificates of the
company](https://www.gob.mx/tramites/ficha/certificado-de-sello-digital/SAT139)
must be uploaded within the `MX Certificates` section. To do so,
navigate to `Settings -->
Accounting --> Electronic Invoicing (MX)`. Under the `MX Certificates`
section, select `Add a line`, and a window will open. Click `Create`,
and from there, upload your digital `Certificate` (`.cer` file), your
`Certificate Key` (`.key` file), and your `Certificate Password`. To
finish, click on `Save
& Close`.

<img src="mexico/mx-certificates.png" class="align-center"
alt="Certificate and key upload inputs." />

> [!TIP]
> If you still do not have one of the contracted
> `PAC (Proveedor Autorizado de Certificación / Authorized Certification
> Provider)`s and you want to test electronic invoicing, you can use the
> following `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` test
> certificates:
>
> - `Certificate <mexico/certificate.cer>`
> - `Certificate Key <mexico/certificate.key>`
> - **Password**: `12345678a`

## Workflows

### Electronic invoicing

The invoicing process in Konvergo ERP is based on [Annex
20](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm)
version 4.0 of electronic invoicing of the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`.

#### Customer invoices

To start invoicing from Konvergo ERP, a customer invoice must be created using
the `standard invoicing
flow <../accounting/customer_invoices>`.

While the document is in draft mode, changes can be made to it (the
correct `Payment Way` or `Usage` that the customer might require can be
added, for example.)

After you `Confirm` the customer invoice, a blue message appears
stating: `The
invoice will be processed asynchronously by the following E-invoicing service: CFDI (4.0)`.

Pressing the `Process Now` button sends the document to the government
so it can be signed. After receiving the signed document back from the
government, the `Fiscal Folio` field appears on the document, and the
XML file is attached in the chatter.

> [!TIP]
> If you click `Retry` in the `SAT status` field on the invoice, you can
> confirm if the XML file is valid in the
> `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`.
>
> If you are in a testing environment, you will always receive the
> message `Not Found`.

To send the signed invoice to your client by mail, you can send both the
XML and PDF files together, directly from Konvergo ERP, by clicking the
`Send & Print` button. You can also download the PDF file to your
computer, by clicking the `Print` button, and selecting the desired
print option.

#### Credit notes

While an invoice is a document type "I" (Ingreso), a credit note is a
document type "E" (Egreso).

The only addition to the `standard flow for credit notes
<../accounting/customer_invoices/credit_notes>` is that, as a
requirement of the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`, there
has to be a relation between a credit note and an invoice through the
fiscal folio.

Because of this requirement, the field `CFDI Origin` adds this relation
with a <span class="title-ref">01\|</span>, followed by the fiscal folio
of the original invoice.

<img src="mexico/mx-creating-credit-note.png" class="align-center"
alt="Example CFDI Origin number." />

> [!TIP]
> For the `CFDI Origin` field to be automatically added, use the
> `Add Credit
> Note` button from the invoice, instead of creating it manually.

#### Payment complements

##### Payment policy

One addition of the Mexican localization is the `Payment Policy` field .
[According to the SAT
documentation](https://www.sat.gob.mx/consultas/92764/comprobante-de-recepcion-de-pagos),
there may be 2 types of payments:

- <span class="title-ref">PUE</span> (Pago en una Sola
  Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)

- <span class="title-ref">PPD</span> (Pago en Parcialidades o
  Diferido/Payment in Installements or Deferred)

  > <div class="seealso">
  >
  > `../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_valuation/integrating_landed_costs`
  >
  > </div>

The difference lies in the *Due Date* or *Payment Terms* of the invoice.

To configure
`PUE (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)`
invoices, navigatge to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`, and
either select an invoice `Due Date` within the same month, or choose a
payment term that does not imply changing the due month (immediate
payment, 15 days, 21 days, all falling within the current month).

<img src="mexico/mx-pue-payment.png" class="align-center"
alt="Example of an invoice with the PUE requirements." />

> [!TIP]
> Some `Payment Terms` are already installed by default, and can be
> managed from `Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Terms`.

To configure
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
Deferred)` invoices, navigate to
`Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`, and select an invoice with a
`Due Date` after the first day of the following month. This also applies
if your `Payment Term` is due in the following month.

<img src="mexico/mx-ppd-payment.png" class="align-center"
alt="Example of an invoice with the PPD requirements." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the
> `PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
> Deferred)` policy implies that an invoice is not going to get paid at
> the moment, the correct `Payment Way` for the
> `PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
> Deferred)` invoices is `99 - Por Definir` (To define).

##### Payment flow

In both cases, the payment process in Konvergo ERP
`is the same <../accounting/customer_invoices>`, the main difference
being payments related to
`PPD (Pago en Parcialidades o Diferido/Payment in Installements or
Deferred)` invoices trigger the creation of a document type "P" (Pago).

If a payment is related to a
`PUE (Pago en una Sola Exhibición/Payment in a Single Exhibition)`
invoice, it can be registered with the wizard, and be associated with
the corresponding invoice. To do so, navigate to
`Accounting --> Customers -->
Invoices`, and select an invoice. Then, click the `Register Payment`
button. The invoice status changes to `In Payment`, since the payment is
effectively validated when it is bank reconciled.

<div class="seealso">

`../accounting/bank/reconciliation`

</div>

While this process is the same for PPD invoices, the addition of the
creating an `electronic
document <../accounting/customer_invoices/electronic_invoicing>` means
some additional requirements are needed to correctly send the document
to the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`.

From an invoice, you need to confirm the specific `Payment Way` where
you received the payment. Because of this, the `Payment Way` field
**cannot** be set as <span class="title-ref">99 - Por Definir (To
Define)</span>.

If you are going to add a bank account number in the `Accounting` tab of
a customer's contact card, it must have a valid account number.

> [!NOTE]
> The exact configurations are in the [Anexo 20 of the
> SAT](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm).
> Usually, the `Bank Account` needs to be 10 or 18 digits for transfers,
> 16 for credit or debit cards.

If a payment is related to a signed invoice with the `Payment Policy`
<span class="title-ref">PPD</span>, Konvergo ERP generates the corresponding
payment complement automatically, once you click `Process
Now`.

<img src="mexico/mx-signed-complement.png" class="align-center"
alt="CFDI (4.0) E-invoicing service process payment now message." />

> [!WARNING]
> A payment in MXN **cannot** be used to pay multiple invoices in USD.
> Instead, the payment should be separated into multiple payments, using

#### Invoice cancellations

It is possible to cancel the EDI documents sent to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`. According to the [Reforma
Fiscal
2022](https://www.sat.gob.mx/consultas/91447/nuevo-esquema-de-cancelacion),
since January 1st, 2022, there are two requirements for this:

- With all cancellation requests, you **must** specify a *cancellation
  reason*.
- After 24 hours have passed since the creation of the invoice, the
  client **must** be asked to accept the cancellation.

There are four different cancellation reasons. In Konvergo ERP, you can cancel
invoices with the reasons *01 Invoices sent with errors with a
relation*, and *02 Invoices sent with errors without a relation*.

The following sections break down the process of canceling invoices for
each cancellation reason in Konvergo ERP.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Konvergo ERP has certain limitations to canceling invoices in the
> `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`: The reasons 03 and 04
> (*Operation did not take place* and *Nominative transactions related
> to a global invoice*, respectively) are not currently supported by
> Konvergo ERP. For this, you need to cancel the invoice directly in the
> `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`, and press `Retry` in
> the `SAT Status field`.

##### 01 - invoices sent with errors with a relation

This cancellation reason must be used when a new invoice needs to
substitute the original one, due to an error in any field.

Begin by navigating to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`, and
select the old invoice. Copy the `Fiscal Folio` from the old invoice.
Then, navigate to the new invoice, and in the `CFDI Origin` field, add
the value <span class="title-ref">04\|</span> and paste the
`Fiscal Folio` of the old invoice after the value. Finally, sign the new
document.

Next, navigate back to the old invoice, and notice the `Substituted By`
field is now available. Click the `Request EDI Cancellation` button on
the old invoice, and then click `Process Now` in the blue section that
appears. The invoice status changes to `Canceled`, and a confirmation is
logged in the chatter.

Now, the invoice should be canceled in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` as well. You can confirm
this was done correctly, by pressing `Retry` in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` status field.

If the document was canceled more than 24 hours after its creation, you
may need to ask the client to accept the cancellation in their “Buzón
Tributario” directly from the [SAT
website](https://www.sat.gob.mx/home).

> [!NOTE]
> The <span class="title-ref">04\|</span> is only a code that helps Konvergo ERP
> to perform this process. It has no relation to the method 04 reason
> for cancellation.

<img src="mexico/mx-01-invoice-cancellation-substitute.png"
class="align-center" alt="Old invoice with CFDI Origin." />

<img src="mexico/mx-01-invoice-cancellation.png" class="align-center"
alt="Invoice with the Substituted By field referencing the CFDI Origin invoice." />

##### 02 - invoices sent with errors without a relation

This cancellation reason has to be used when an invoice was sent with an
error in any field, and does not need to be replaced by another one.

For this case, navigate to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`, and
select the old invoice. From here, the only requirement is to click the
`Request EDI Cancellation` button, and then click the `Process Now`
button.

Because the field `Substituted By` does not appear when using this
cancellation reason, the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`
should automatically detect that the cancellation reason is 02.

##### Payment cancellations

It is also possible to cancel *Payment Complements*. For this, go to the
payment, via `Accounting --> Customers --> Payments`, and select
`Request EDI
Cancellation`. As with invoices, a blue button will appear. Click
`Process now`, and the document will be sent to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`. After a few seconds, you
can click `Retry` to confirm the current
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` status.

Finally, the payment status is moved to `Cancelled`.

> [!NOTE]
> Just like invoices, when you create a new *Payment Complement*, you
> can add the relation of the original document, by adding a
> <span class="title-ref">04\|</span> plus the fiscal folio in the
> `CFDI Origin` field.

#### Invoicing special use cases

##### CFDI to public

If the customer you are selling goods or services to does not require an
invoice, a *CFDI to Public* has to be created.

If you use the `Customer` name <span class="title-ref">PUBLICO EN
GENERAL</span>, an error will be triggered. This is a main change in the
CFDI 4.0 that requires invoices with that specific name to need
additional fields, which Konvergo ERP does not currently support. So, for a
*CFDI to Public* to be created, you need to add any name to your
customer that is **not** <span class="title-ref">PUBLICO EN
GENERAL</span>. (For example: <span class="title-ref">CLIENTE
FINAL</span>).

In addition to this, it is required that the `ZIP` code of your company
is added, the generic `RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)` is set
as <span class="title-ref">XAXX010101000</span>, and the `Fiscal Regime`
of your customer must be set as: <span class="title-ref">Sin
obligaciones fiscales</span>.

<img src="mexico/mx-cfdi-to-public.png" class="align-center"
alt="CFDI to Public Customer field configuration." />

##### Multicurrency

The main currency in Mexico is MXN. While this is mandatory for all
Mexican companies, it is possible to send and receive invoices (and
payments) in different currencies. To enable the use of
`multicurrency <../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>`, navigate to
the `Accounting --> Settings --> Currencies`, and set `Mexican Bank` as
the `Service` in the `Automatic Currency Rates` section. Then, set the
`Interval` field to the frequency you wish to update the exchange rates.

This way, the XML file of the document will have the correct exchange
rate, and the total amount, in both the foreign currency and in MXN.

It is highly recommended to use `a bank account for each currency
<../accounting/bank/foreign_currency>`.

> [!NOTE]
> The only currencies that automatically update their exchange rate
> daily are: USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY.

<img src="mexico/mx-multicurrency-1.png" class="align-center"
alt="Multi-currency configuration in the Accounting settings." />

##### Down payments

There can be cases where you receive a payment in advance from a
customer that needs to be applied to an invoice later. In order to do
this in Konvergo ERP, it is required to properly link invoices to each other
with the `CFDI Origin` field. To do so, it is necessary to have the
`Sales
<../../sales>` app installed.

<div class="seealso">

[The official documentation for registration of down payments in
Mexico](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/documentos/Caso_uso_Anticipo.pdf).

</div>

First, navigate to the `Sales` app to create a product
<span class="title-ref">Anticipo</span> and configure it. The
`Product Type` must be `Service`, and use the `UNSPSC Category` must be:
<span class="title-ref">84111506 Servicios de facturación</span>.

Then, go to `Sales --> Settings --> Invoicing --> Down Payments`, and
add the *Anticipo* product as the default.

Create a sales order with the total amount, and create a down payment
(either using a percentage or fixed amount). Then, sign the document,
and `Register the Payment`.

When the time comes for the customer to get the final invoice, create it
again from the same sales order. In the `Create Invoices` wizard, select
`Regular Invoice`, and uncheck `Deduct down payments`.

Then, copy the `Fiscal Folio` from the first invoice, and paste it into
the `CDFI Origin` of the second invoice, adding the prefix
<span class="title-ref">07\|</span> before the value. Then, sign the
document.

After this, create a credit note for the first invoice. Copy the
`Fiscal Folio` from the second invoice, and paste it in the
`CFDI Origin` of the credit note, adding the prefix
<span class="title-ref">07\|</span>. Then, sign the document.

With this, all electronic documents are linked to each other. The final
step is to fully pay the new invoice. At the bottom of the new invoice,
you can find the credit note in the `Outstanding credits` - add it as
payment. Finally, register the remaining amount with the
`Register Payment` wizard.

### External trade

The external trade is a complement to a regular invoice that adds
certain values in both the XML and PDF, to invoices with a foreign
customer according to [SAT
regulations](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/complemento_comercio_exterior.htm),
such as:

- The specific address of the receiver and the sender
- The addition of a `Tariff Fraction` that identifies the type of
  product
- The correct `Incoterm` (International Commercial Terms), among others
  (*certificate of origin* and *special units of measure*).

This allows the correct identification of exporters and importers, in
addition to expanding the description of the merchandise sold.

Since January 1, 2018, external trade is a requirement for taxpayers,
who carry export operations of type A1. While the current CFDI is 4.0,
the external trade is currently on version 1.1

In order to use this feature, the modules `l10n_mx_edi_extended` and
`l10n_mx_edi_extended_40` have to be installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before installing, make sure your business needs to use this feature.
> Consult your accountant first, if needed, before installing any
> modules.

#### Configuration

##### Contacts

To configure your company contact for external trade, navigate to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Customers`, and select your `Company`. While the CFDI 4.0
requirements ask you to add a valid `ZIP` code in your contact, the
external trade complement adds the requirement that your `City` and the
`State` must also be valid. All three fields must coincide with the
[Official SAT
Catalog](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/catalogos_emision_cfdi_complemento_ce.htm),
or you will receive an error.

> [!WARNING]
> Add the `City` and `State` in the company's *contact*, not in the
> company itself. You can find your company's contact in
> `Accounting --> Customers -->
> Customers`.

The fields `Locality` and `Colony Code` are optional and can be added in
the company directly in `Settings --> General Settings --> Companies`.
These two fields have to coincide with the data in the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`.

<img src="mexico/mx-external-trade-rescompany.png" class="align-center"
alt="Optional external trade company fields." />

To configure the contact data for a foreign receiving client, navigate
to `Accounting
--> Customers --> Customers`, and select the foreign client's contact.
The contact must have the following fields completed to avoid errors:

1.  The entire company `Address`, including a valid `ZIP` code and the
    foreign `Country`.
2.  The format of the foreign `VAT` (tax identification number, for
    example: Colombia <span class="title-ref">123456789-1</span>)
3.  In the `MX EDI` tab, you need to address if the customer receives
    goods for a period of time temporarily (`Temporary`) or permanently
    (`Definitive`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the new contact was created by duplicating another existing contact
> from Mexico, make sure to delete any carried over information from the
> `Fiscal Regime` field. In addition, do not enable the
> `No Tax Breakdown` option. Selecting this option hides mandatory
> fields that are required for external trade contact configuration.

<img src="mexico/mx-external-trade-customer-contact.png"
class="align-center" alt="Required external trade customer fields." />

> [!NOTE]
> In the resulting XML and PDF files, the `VAT` is automatically
> replaced by the generic VAT for abroad transactions:
> <span class="title-ref">XEXX010101000</span>.

##### Products

All products involved with external trade have four fields that are
required, two of them exclusive to external trade.

1.  The `Internal Reference` of the product is in the
    `General Information` tab.
2.  The `Weight` of the product must be more than
    <span class="title-ref">0</span>.
3.  The
    [correct](https://www.ventanillaunica.gob.mx/vucem/Clasificador.html)
    `Tariff
    Fraction` of the product in the `Accounting` tab.
4.  The `UMT Aduana` corresponds to the `Tariff Fraction`.

<img src="mexico/mx-external-trade-product.png" class="align-center"
alt="Required external trade product fields." />

> [!TIP]
> - If the UoM code of the `Tariff Fraction` is
> <span class="title-ref">01</span>, the correct `UMT Aduana` is
> <span class="title-ref">kg</span>. - If the UoM code of the
> `Tariff Fraction` is <span class="title-ref">06</span>, the correct
> `UMT Aduana` is <span class="title-ref">Units</span>.

#### Invoicing flow

Before creating an invoice, it is important to take into account that
external trade invoices require to convert the amounts of your product
into USD. Therefore, `multicurrency
<../accounting/get_started/multi_currency>` **must** be enabled and
*USD* **must** be activated in the `Currencies` section. The correct
`Service` to run is `Mexican
Bank`.

Then, with the correct exchange rate set up in
`Accounting --> Settings -->
Currency`, the only fields left are `Incoterm` and the optional
`Certificate
Source` in the `Other Info` tab.

<img src="mexico/mx-external-trade-other-info.png" class="align-center"
alt="External trade Other Info tab of a product." />

Finally, sign the invoice with the same process as a regular invoice,
and click the `Process Now` button.

### Delivery guide

A [Carta
Porte](https://www.sat.gob.mx/consultas/68823/complemento-carta-porte-)
is a bill of lading: a document that states the type, quantity, and
destination of goods being carried.

On December 1st, 2021, version 2.0 of this CFDI was implemented for all
transportation providers, intermediaries, and owners of goods. Konvergo ERP is
able to generate a document type "T" (Traslado), which, unlike other
documents, is created in a delivery order instead of an invoice or
payment.

Konvergo ERP can create XML and PDF files with (or without) ground transport,
and can process materials that are treated as *Dangerous Hazards*.

In order to use this feature, the modules `l10n_mx_edi_extended`,
`l10n_mx_edi_extended_40`, `l10n_mx_edi_stock` and
`l10n_mx_edi_stock_40` have to be installed.

In addition to this, it is necessary to have the `Inventory
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory>` and `Sales <../../sales/sales>`
apps installed, as well.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Konvergo ERP does not support Carta Porte type document type "I" (Ingreso),
> air, or marine transport. Consult your accountant first if this
> feature is needed before doing any modifications.

#### Configuration

Konvergo ERP manages two different types of CFDI:

- **No Federal Highways**: Is used when the *Distance to Destination* is
  [less than 30
  KM](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/cartaporte/Paginas/documentos/PreguntasFrecuentes_Autotransporte.pdf).
- **Federal Transport**: Is used when the *Distance to Destination*
  exceeds 30 KM.

Other than the standard requirements of regular invoicing (The
`RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes)` of the customer, the UNSPSC
code, etc.), if you are using *No Federal Highways*, no external
configuration is needed.

For *Federal Transport*, several configurations have to be added to
contacts, vehicle setups, and products. Those configurations are added
to the XML and PDF files.

##### Contacts and vehicles

Like the external trade feature, the `Address` in both the company and
the final customer must be complete. The `ZIP` code, `City`, and `State`
must coincide with the <span class="title-ref">Official SAT Catalog for
Carta Porte \<sat-catalog\_\>\_</span>.

> [!TIP]
> The field, `Locality`, is optional for both addresses.

<img src="mexico/mx-delivery-guide-contacts.png" class="align-center"
alt="Delivery guide contact configuration." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The origin address used for the delivery guide is set in
> `Inventory -->
> Configuration --> Warehouses Management --> Warehouses`. While this is
> set as the company address by default, you can change it according to
> your correct warehouse address.

Another addition to this feature is the `Vehicle Setups` menu found in
`Inventory --> Settings --> Mexico`. This menu lets you add all the
information related to the vehicle used for the delivery order.

All fields are mandatory to create a correct delivery guide.

> [!TIP]
> The fields, `Vehicle Plate Number` and `Number Plate`, must contain
> between 5 to 7 characters.

In the `Intermediaries` section, you must add the operator of the
vehicle. The only mandatory fields for this contact are the `VAT` and
`Operator Licence`.

<img src="mexico/mx-delivery-guide-vehicle.png" class="align-center"
alt="Delivery guide vehicle configuration." />

##### Products

Similar to regular invoicing, all products must have a
`UNSPSC category`. In addition to this, there are two extra
configurations for products involved in delivery guides:

- The `Product Type` must be set as `Storable Product` for stock
  movements to be created.
- In the `Inventory` tab, the field `Weight` should have more than
  <span class="title-ref">0</span>.

> [!WARNING]
> Creating a delivery guide of a product with the value
> <span class="title-ref">0</span> will trigger an error. As the
> `Weight` has been already stored in the delivery order, it is needed
> to return the products, and create the delivery order (and delivery
> guide) again with the correct amounts.

<img src="mexico/mx-delivery-guide-products.png" class="align-center"
alt="Delivery guide product configuration." />

#### Sales and inventory flow

To create a delivery guide, first, you need to create and confirm a
sales order from `Sales --> Sales Order`. This generates a `Delivery`
smart button. Click it, and `Validate` the transfer.

After the status is set to `Done`, you can edit the transfer, and select
the `Transport Type` (either `No Federal Highways` or `Federal
Transport`).

If your delivery guide has the type `No Federal Highways`, you can save
the transfer, and then click `Generate Delivery Guide`. The resulting
XML can be found in the chatter.

> [!NOTE]
> Other than the `UNSPSC` in all products, delivery guides that use
> `No Federal
> Highways` do not require any special configuration to be sent to the
> government.

If your delivery guide has the type, `Federal Transport`, the tab
`MX EDI` appears. There, enter a value in `Distance to Destination (KM)`
bigger than <span class="title-ref">0</span>, and select the
`Vehicle Setup` used for this delivery.

<img src="mexico/mx-delivery-guide-federal-transport.png"
class="align-center" alt="Delivery guide MX EDI tab configuration." />

##### Dangerous hazards

Certain values in the `UNSPSC Category` are considered in the [official
SAT
catalog](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/complemento_carta_porte.htm)
as *dangerous hazards*. These categories need additional considerations
when creating a delivery guide with `Federal Transport`.

First, select your product from `Inventory --> Products --> Products`.
Then, in the `Accounting` tab, the fields
`Hazardous Material Designation Code (MX)` and
`Hazardous Packaging (MX)` must be filled with the correct code from the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` catalog.

<img src="mexico/mx-delivery-guide-hazards-designation.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Delivery guide hazardous material product required fields." />

In `Inventory --> Settings --> Mexico --> Vehicle Setup`, the data from
the `Environment Insurer` and `Environment Insurance Policy` has to be
filed, as well. After this, continue with the regular process to create
a delivery guide.

<img src="mexico/mx-delivery-guide-hazards-environment.png"
class="align-center"
alt="Delivery Guide environment insurer required fields." />

### Customs numbers

A *customs declaration* (Pedimento Aduanero) is a fiscal document that
certifies that all contributions to the fiscal entity (the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`) has been paid for,
including the import/export of goods.

According to the [Annex
20](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/tramitesyservicios/Paginas/anexo_20.htm) of
CFDI 4.0, in documents where the invoiced goods come from a first-hand
import operation, the field, `Customs Number`, needs to be added to all
lines of products involved with the operation.

To do so, the module `l10n_mx_edi_landing` must be installed, in
addition to the `Inventory <../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory>`,
`Purchase
<../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase>` and `Sales <../../sales/sales>`
apps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not confuse this feature with external trade. The customs numbers
> are directly related to importing goods, while the external trade
> complement is related to exporting. Consult your accountant first if
> this feature is needed before doing any modifications.

#### Configuration

In order to track the correct customs number for a specific invoice,
Konvergo ERP uses `landed costs
<../../inventory_and_mrp/inventory/warehouses_storage/inventory_valuation/integrating_landed_costs>`.
Go to `Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings --> Valuation`. Make
sure that `Landed Costs` is activated.

Begin by creating a *service*-type product called,
<span class="title-ref">Pedimento</span>. In the `Purchase` tab,
activate `Is a Landed Cost`, and select a `Default Split Method`.

Then, configure the *storable products* that hold the customs numbers.
To do so, create the storable products, and make sure the
`Product Category` has the following configuration.

- `Costing Method`: Either `FIFO` or `AVCO`
- `Inventory Valuation`: `Automated`
- `Stock Valuation Account`: `115.01.01 Inventario`
- `Stock Journal`: `Inventory Valuation`
- `Stock Input Account`: `115.05.01 Mercancías en tránsito`
- `Stock Output Account`: `115.05.01 Mercancías en tránsito`

<img src="mexico/mx-landing-configuration.png" class="align-center"
alt="Storable products general configuration." />

<img src="mexico/mx-landing-configuration-category.png"
class="align-center" alt="Storable product category configuration." />

#### Purchase and sales flow

After you configure your product, follow the standard `purchase flow
<../../inventory_and_mrp/purchase>`.

Create a purchase order from `Purchase --> Orders --> Purchase Order`.
Then, confirm the order to display a `Receipt` smart button. Click on
the `Receipt` smart button to `Validate` the receipt.

Go to `Inventory --> Operations --> Landed Costs`, and create a new
record. Add the transfer that you just created, and both: the product
<span class="title-ref">Pedimento</span> and `Customs number`.

Optionally, you can add a cost amount. After this, validate the landed
cost. Once `Posted`, all products related to that receipt have the
customs number assigned.

> [!WARNING]
> You can only add the *Pedimentos* number **once**, so be careful when
> associating the correct number with the transfer(s).

<img src="mexico/mx-landing-inventory.png" class="align-center"
alt="Customs number on a landed costs Inventory record." />

Now, create a sales order, and confirm it. This should trigger a
`Delivery` smart button. Validate it.

Finally, create an invoice from the sales order, and confirm it. The
invoice line related to your product has a customs number in it. This
number should match the customs number added in the *Landed Costs*
record you created earlier.

<img src="mexico/mx-landing-invoice.png" class="align-center"
alt="Customs number on confirmed sales order product." />

### Electronic accounting

For Mexico, [Electronic
Accounting](https://www.sat.gob.mx/aplicacion/42150/envia-tu-contabilidad-electronica)
refers to the obligation to keep accounting records and entries through
electronic means, and to enter accounting information on a monthly
basis, through the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`
website.

It consists of three main XML files:

1.  The updated list of the chart of accounts that you are currently
    using.
2.  A monthly trial balance, plus a closing entry report, also known as:
    *Trial Balance Month 13*.
3.  Either optional, or for a compulsory audit, an export of the journal
    entries in your general ledger.

The resulting XML files follow the requirements of the [Anexo Técnico de
Contabilidad Electrónica
1.3](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/151135/Anexo24_05012015.pdf).

In addition to this, you can generate the [DIOT
\<https://www.sat.gob.mx/declaracion/74295/presenta-tu-declaracion-informativa-de-operaciones-con-
terceros-(diot)-\>](): A report of vendor's journal entries that involve
IVA taxes that can be exported in a `.txt` file.

In order to use these reports, the modules `l10n_mx_reports`,
`l10n_mx_reports_closing`, `l10n_mx_xml_polizas` and
`l10n_mx_xml_polizas_edi` have to be installed, as well as the
`Accounting
<../accounting/get_started>`.

You can find the *Chart of accounts*, *Trial Balance Month 13*, and
*DIOT* reports in `Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The specific characteristics and obligations of the reports that you
> send might change according to your fiscal regime. Always contact your
> accountant before sending any documents to the government.

#### Chart of accounts

The `chart of accounts <../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts>` in
México follows a specific pattern based on
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`'s' [Código agrupador de
cuentas](http://omawww.sat.gob.mx/fichas_tematicas/buzon_tributario/Documents/codigo_agrupador.pdf).

You can create any account, as long as it respects
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`'s encoding group: the
pattern is <span class="title-ref">NNN.YY.ZZ</span> or
<span class="title-ref">NNN.YY.ZZZ</span>.

<div class="example">

Some examples are <span class="title-ref">102.01.99</span> or
<span class="title-ref">401.01.001</span>.

</div>

When a new account is created in
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Chart of
Accounts`, with the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`
encoding group pattern, the correct grouping code appears in `Tags`, and
your account appears in the *COA* report.

Once you create all your accounts, make sure the correct `Tags` are
added.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use any pattern that ends a section with a 0 (such as
> <span class="title-ref">100.01.01</span>,
> <span class="title-ref">301.00.003</span> or
> <span class="title-ref">604.77.00</span>). This triggers errors in the
> report.

Once everything is set up, you can go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico -->
COA`, and click the `SAT (XML)` button to generate an XML file
containing all of your accounts, which will be ready to upload to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` website.

#### Trial balance

The trial balance reports the initial balance, credit, and total balance
of your accounts, provided that you added their correct
`encoding group <l10n_mx/chart-of-accounts>`.

This report can be generated monthly, and a corresponding XML file is
created, if you go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico --> Trial Balance`, and click the
`SAT (XML)` button. Select the month you want to download beforehand.

<img src="mexico/mx-reports-trial-balance.png" class="align-center"
alt="Trial balance report." />

> [!NOTE]
> Konvergo ERP does not generate the *Balanza de Comprobación Complementaria*.

An additional report is the *Month 13*: a closing balance sheet that
shows any adjustments or movements made in the accounting to close the
year.

To generate this XML document, navigate to
`Accounting --> Accounting -->
Miscellaneous --> Journal Entries`, and create a new document. Here, add
all amounts to modify, and balance the debit and/or credit of each one.

After this is done, click `Mark as Closing Entry`, and the report found
in `Accounting --> Reporting --> Mexico --> Trial Balance Month 13`,
contains the total amount of the year, plus all the additions of the
journal entry.

The XML file is generated by pressing the `SAT (XML)` button.

<img src="mexico/mx-reports-trial-balance-13.png" class="align-center"
alt="Trial Balance Month 13 setup." />

<img src="mexico/mx-reports-trial-balance-13-report.png"
class="align-center" alt="Trial Balance Month 13 report." />

#### General ledger

By law, all transactions in Mexico must be recorded digitally. Since
Konvergo ERP automatically creates all the underlying journal entries of your
invoicing and payments, you can export your journal entries to comply
with `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`'s audits and/or tax
refunds.

> [!TIP]
> You can filter by period, or by journal, according to your current
> needs.

To create the XML, go to
`Accounting --> Reporting --> Audit Reports --> General
Ledger`, and click `XML (Polizas)`. Here, you can select between four
types of `Export` types:

- `Tax audit`
- `Audit certification`
- `Return of goods`
- `Compensation`

For `Tax audit`, or `Audit certification`, you need to write the
`Order Number` provided by the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`. For `Return of goods`, or
`Compensation`, you need to write your `Process Number`, also provided
by the `SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to see this report without sending it, use
> <span class="title-ref">ABC6987654/99</span> for `Order
> Number` and <span class="title-ref">AB123451234512</span> for
> `Process Number`.

#### DIOT report

The DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros /
*Informative Declaration of Operations with Third Parties*) is an
additional obligation with the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`, where the current status
of creditable and non-creditable payments, withholdings, and refunds of
VAT from your vendor bills, are provided to the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)`.

Unlike other reports, the
`DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)` is uploaded
to a software provided by the
`SAT (Servicio de Administración Tributaria)` that contains the A-29
form. In Konvergo ERP, you can download the records of your transactions as a
`.txt` file that can be uploaded to the form, avoiding direct capture of
this data.

The transactions file contains the total amount of your payments
registered in vendor bills, broken down into the corresponding types of
IVA. The `VAT` and `Country` is mandatory for all vendors.

To get the `DIOT (Declaración Informativa de Operaciones con Terceros)`
report, go to `Accounting --> Reports --> Mexico --> Transactions
with third parties [DIOT]`. Select the month that suits you, and click
`DIOT (TXT)` to download the `.txt` file.

> You need to fill the field, `L10N Mx Type of Operation`, in the
> `Accounting` tab of each one of your vendors to prevent validation
> errors. Make sure that your foreign customers have their country set
> up for `L10N Mx Nationality` to appear automatically.
