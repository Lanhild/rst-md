## e-Invoice system

Konvergo ERP is compliant with the **Indian Goods and Services Tax (GST)
e-Invoice system** requirements.

### Setup

#### NIC e-Invoice registration

You must register on the `NIC (National Informatics Centre)` e-Invoice
portal to get your **API credentials**. You need these credentials to
`configure your Konvergo ERP Accounting app
<india/e-invoicing-configuration>`.

1.  Log in to the [NIC e-Invoice portal](https://einvoice1.gst.gov.in/)
    by clicking `Login` and entering your `Username` and `Password`;

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are already registered on the NIC portal, you can use the
    > same login credentials.

    ![Register Konvergo ERP ERP system on e-invoice web portal](india/e-invoice-system-login.png)

2.  From the dashboard, go to
    `API Registration --> User Credentials --> Create API
    User`;

3.  After that, you should receive an `OTP (one-time password)` code on
    your registered mobile number. Enter the OTP code and click
    `Verify OTP`;

4.  Select `Through GSP` for the API interface, set
    `Tera Software Limited` as GSP, and type in a `Username` and
    `Password` for your API. Once it is done, click `Submit`.

    ![Submit API specific Username and Password](india/submit-api-registration-details.png)

#### Configuration in Konvergo ERP

To enable the e-Invoice service in Konvergo ERP, go to
`Accounting --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Indian Electronic Invoicing`, and enter the `Username` and
`Password` previously set for the API.

![Setup e-invoice service](india/e-invoice-setup.png)

##### Journals

To automatically send e-Invoices to the NIC e-Invoice portal, you must
first configure your *sales* journal by going to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`, opening your *sales*
journal, and in the `Advanced Settings` tab, under `Electronic Data
Interchange`, enable `E-Invoice (IN)` and save.

### Workflow

#### Invoice validation

Once an invoice is validated, a confirmation message is displayed at the
top. Konvergo ERP automatically uploads the JSON-signed file of validated
invoices to the NIC e-Invoice portal after some time. If you want to
process the invoice immediately, click `Process now`.

![Indian e-invoicing confirmation message](india/e-invoice-process.png)

> [!NOTE]
> - You can find the JSON-signed file in the attached files in the
> chatter. - You can check the document's
> `EDI (electronic data interchange)` status under the `EDI Document`
> tab or the `Electronic invoicing` field of the invoice.

#### Invoice PDF report

Once an invoice is validated and submitted, the invoice PDF report can
be printed. The report includes the `IRN (Invoice Reference Number)`,
`Ack. No` (acknowledgment number) and `Ack. Date` (acknowledgment date),
and QR code. These certify that the invoice is a valid fiscal document.

![IRN and QR code](india/invoice-report.png)

#### e-Invoice cancellation

If you want to cancel an e-Invoice, go to the `Other info` tab of the
invoice and fill out the `Cancel reason` and `Cancel remarks` fields.
Then, click `Request
EDI cancellation`. The status of the `Electronic invoicing` field
changes to `To
Cancel`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Doing so cancels both the `e-Invoice <india/e-invoicing>` and the
> `E-Way bill
> <india/e-waybill>`.

![cancel reason and remarks](india/e-invoice-cancellation.png)

> [!NOTE]
> - If you want to abort the cancellation before processing the invoice,
> then click `Call
> Off EDI Cancellation`. - Once you request to cancel the e-Invoice,
> Konvergo ERP automatically submits the JSON-signed file to the NIC e-Invoice
> portal. You can click `Process now` if you want to process the invoice
> immediately.

#### GST e-Invoice verification

After submitting an e-Invoice, you can verify if the invoice is signed
from the GST e-Invoice system website itself.

1.  Download the JSON file from the attached files. It can be found in
    the chatter of the related invoice;

2.  Open the [NIC e-Invoice portal](https://einvoice1.gst.gov.in/) and
    go to `Search --> Verify Signed Invoice`;

3.  Select the JSON file and submit it;

    If the file is signed, a confirmation message is displayed.
