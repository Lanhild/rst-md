## Company information

Navigate to `Settings --> Companies: Update Info` and ensure the
following company information is up-to-date and correctly filled in:

- `Company Name`
- `Address`:
  - `Street`
  - `City`
  - `State`
  - `ZIP`
  - `Country`
- `Tax ID`: enter the identification number for the selected
  `Taxpayer Type
  <chile/fiscal-info>`.
- `Activity Names`: select up to four activity codes.
- `Company Activity Description`: enter a short description of the
  company's activity.

## Accounting settings

Next, navigate to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Chilean
Localization` and follow the instructions to configure the:

- `Fiscal information <chile/fiscal-info>`
- `Electronic invoice data <chile/electronic-invoice>`
- `DTE incoming email server <chile/dte-email>`
- `Signature certificates <chile/certificate>`

### Fiscal information

Configure the following `Tax payer information`:

- `Taxpayer Type` by selecting the taxpayer type that applies:
  - `VAT Affected (1st Category)`: for invoices that charge taxes to
    customers
  - `Fees Receipt Issuer (2nd Category)`: for suppliers who issue fees
    receipt (Boleta)
  - `End consumer`: only issues receipts
  - `Foreigner`
- `SII Office`: select your company's
  `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` regional office

### Electronic invoice data

Select your `SII Web Services` environment:

- `SII - Test`: for test databases using test `CAFs (Folio
  Authorization Code)` obtained from the
  `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`. In this mode, the direct
  connection flows can be tested, with the files being sent to the
  `SII (Servicio
  de Impuestos Internos)`.
- `SII - Production`: for production databases.
- `SII - Demo Mode`: files are created and accepted automatically in
  demo mode but are **not** sent to the
  `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`. For this reason, rejection
  errors or *Accepted with Objections* will not appear in this mode.
  Every internal validation can be tested in demo mode. Avoid selecting
  this option in a production database.

Then, enter the `Legal Electronic Invoicing Data`:

- `SII Resolution N°`
- `SII Resolution Date`

<img src="chile/electronic-invoice-data.png" class="align-center"
alt="Required information for electronic invoice." />

## DTE incoming email server

The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`
`Email Box Electronic Invoicing` can be defined to receive your
customers' claim and acceptance emails. Enabling this option from
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Chilean Localization` is
necessary if you want to use *Email Box Electronic Invoicing* as the
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios
Electrónicos)` incoming email server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to receive your SII documents, it's necessary to set up your
> own email server. More information on how to do this can be found in
> this documentation: `../../general/email_communication/email_servers`

Begin by clicking `Configure DTE Incoming Email`, then click `New` to
add a server and fill in the following fields:

- `Name`: give the server a name.
- `Server Type`: select the server type used.
  - `IMAP Server`
  - `POP Server`
  - `Local Server`: uses a local script to fetch emails and create new
    records. The script can be found in the `Configuration` section with
    this option selected.
  - `Gmail OAuth Authentication`: requires your Gmail API credentials to
    be configured in the general settings. A direct link to the
    configuration can be found in the `Login
    Information` section.
- `DTE Server`: enable this option. By checking this option, this email
  account will be used to receive the electronic invoices from the
  suppliers, and communications from the `SII
  (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` regarding the electronic invoices
  issued. In this case, this email should match both emails declared on
  the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` site in the section:
  *ACTUALIZACION DE DATOS DEL CONTRIBUYENTE*, *Mail Contacto SII* and
  *Mail Contacto Empresas*.

In the `Server & Login` tab (for IMAP and POP servers):

- `Server Name`: enter the hostname or IP of the server.
- `Port`: enter the server port.
- `SSL/TLS`: enable this option if connections are encrypted using the
  SSL/TLS protocol.
- `Username`: enter the server login username.
- `Password`: enter the server login password.

<img src="chile/dte-incoming-email.png" class="align-center"
alt="Incoming email server configuration for Chilean DTE." />

> [!TIP]
> Before going live, it is recommended to archive or remove all emails
> related to vendor bills that are not required to be processed in Konvergo ERP
> from your inbox.

### Certificate

A digital certificate in <span class="title-ref">.pfx</span> format is
required to generate the electronic invoice signature. To add one, click
`Configure Signature Certificates` under the `Signature
Certificates` section. Then, click `New` to configure the certificate:

- `Certificate Key`: click `Upload your file` and select the
  <span class="title-ref">.pfx</span> file.
- `Certificate Passkey`: enter the file's passphrase.
- `Subject Serial Number`: depending on the certificate format, the
  field might not be automatically populated. In that case, enter the
  certificate's legal representative `RUT
  (Rol Único Tributario)`.
- `Certificate Owner`: select one if you need to restrict the
  certificate for a specific user. Leave the field empty to share it
  with all billing users.

<img src="chile/new-certificate.png" class="align-center"
alt="Digital certificate configuration." />

## Multicurrency

The official currency rate is provided by [Chilean
mindicador.cl](https://mindicador.cl). Navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Currencies: Automatic Currency
Rates` to set an `Interval` for when the rate is automatically updated,
or to select another `Service`.

## Partner information

Configuring partner contacts is also required to send
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` electronic invoices. Open the
`Contacts` app to do so and fill in the following fields on a new or
existing contact form.

- `Name`
- `Email`
- `Identification Number`
- `Taxpayer Type`
- `Activity Description`

In the `Electronic Invoicing` tab:

- `DTE Email`: enter the sender's email address for the partner.
- `Delivery Guide Price`: select which price the delivery guide
  displays, if any.

> [!NOTE]
> The `DTE Email` is the email used for sending electronic documents and
> must be set in the contact that will be part of an electronic
> document.

<img src="chile/dte-email-electronic-invoice.png" class="align-center"
alt="Chilean electronic invoice data for partners." />

## Document types

Accounting documents are categorized by
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`-defined document types.

Document types are created automatically upon installation of the
localization module, and can be managed by navigating to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Document Types`.

<img src="chile/chilean-document-types.png" class="align-center"
alt="Chilean fiscal document types list." />

> [!NOTE]
> Several document types are inactive by default but can be activated by
> toggling the `Active` option.

### Use on invoices

The document type on each transaction is determined by:

- The journal related to the invoice, identifying if the journal uses
  documents.
- The condition applied based on the type of issuer and recipient (e.g.,
  the buyer or vendor's fiscal regime).

## Journals

*Sales journals* in Konvergo ERP usually represent a business unit or location.

<div class="example">

\- Ventas Santiago. - Ventas Valparaiso.

</div>

For retail stores it is common to have one journal per
`POS (Point of Sale)`.

<div class="example">

\- Cashier 1. - Cashier 2.

</div>

The *purchase* transactions can be managed with a single journal, but
sometimes companies use more than one journal in order to handle some
accounting transactions that are not related to vendor bills. This
configuration can easily be set by using the following model.

<div class="example">

\- Tax payments to the government. - Employees payments.

</div>

### Create a sales journal

To create a sales journal, navigate to
`Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`. Then, click the `New`
button, and fill in the following required information:

- `Type`: select `Sale` from the drop-down menu for customer invoice
  journals.
- `Point of sale type`: if the sales journal will be used for electronic
  documents, the option `Online` must be selected. Otherwise, if the
  journal is used for invoices imported from a previous system or if you
  are using the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos
  Internos)` portal *Facturación MiPyme*, you can use the option
  `Manual`.
- `Use Documents`: check this field if the journal will use document
  types. This field is only applicable to purchase and sales journals
  that can be related to the different sets of document types available
  in Chile. By default, all the sales journals created will use
  documents.

Next, from the `Jounal Entries` tab, define the `Default Income Account`
and `Dedicated Credit Note Squence` in the `Accounting Information`
section. Configuring these fields is required for one of the debit notes
`use cases <chile/use-cases>`.

## CAF

A *folio authorization code* (CAF) is required for each document type
that will be issued electronically. The `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`
is a file the `SII (Servicio de
Impuestos Internos)` provides to the issuer with the folios/sequences
authorized for the electronic invoice documents.

Your company can request multiple folios and obtain several
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Codes)` linked to different folio ranges.
These `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)` are shared within all journals,
so you only need one active `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)` per
document type, and it will be applied to all journals.

Please refer to the [SII
documentation](https://palena.sii.cl/dte/mn_timbraje.html) to check the
details on how to acquire the `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)` files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)` required by the
> `SII (Servicio de Impuestos
> Internos)` are different from production to test (certification mode).
> Make sure you have the correct `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)` set
> depending on your environment.

### Upload CAF files

Once the `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)` files have been acquired from
the `SII
(Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` portal, they need to be uploaded in
the database by navigating to
`Accounting --> Configuration: Chilean SII --> CAFs`. Then, click the
`New` begin the configuration. On the `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)`
form, upload your `CAF
(Folio Authorization Code)` file by clicking the `Upload your file`
button and then click `Save`.

Once uploaded, the status changes to `In Use`. At this moment, when a
transaction is used for this document type, the invoice number takes the
first folio in the sequence.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The document types have to be active before uploading the
> `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)` files. In case some folios have been
> used in the previous system, the next valid folio has to be set when
> the first transaction is created.

## Chart of accounts

The chart of accounts is installed by default as part of the data set
included in the localization module. The accounts are mapped
automatically in:

- Taxes
- Default Account Payable
- Default Account Receivable
- Transfer Accounts
- Conversion Rate

<div class="seealso">

`../accounting/get_started/chart_of_accounts`

</div>

## Taxes

As part of the localization module, taxes are created automatically with
their related financial account and configuration. These taxes can be
managed from `Accounting -->
Configuration --> Taxes`.

Chile has several tax types, the most common ones are:

- **VAT**: the regular VAT can have several rates.
- **ILA**: the tax for alcoholic drinks.

<div class="seealso">

`../accounting/taxes`

</div>

## Usage and testing

### Electronic invoice workflow

In the Chilean localization, the electronic invoice workflow includes
customer invoice issuance and vendor bill reception. The following
diagram explains how information is shared to the `SII
(Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`, customers, and vendors.

<img src="chile/electronic-invoice-workflow.png" class="align-center"
alt="Diagram with Electronic invoice transactions." />

### Customer invoice emission

After the partners and journals are created and configured, the invoices
are created in the standard way. For Chile, one of the differences is
the document type that is automatically selected based on the taxpayer.
The document type can be changed manually if needed on the invoice by
navigating to `Accounting --> Customers --> Invoices`.

<img src="chile/customer-invoice-document-type.png" class="align-center"
alt="Customer invoice document type selection." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Documents type 33` electronic invoice must have at least one item
> with tax, otherwise the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` rejects
> the document validation.

#### Validation and DTE status

Once all invoice information is filled, either manually or automatically
when generated from a sales order, validate the invoice. After the
invoice is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` file is created
  automatically and recorded in the chatter.

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)`
  `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` status is set as `Pending` to
  be sent.

  <img src="chile/xml-creation.png" class="align-center"
  alt="DTE XML File displayed in chatter." />

The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` status is updated
automatically by Konvergo ERP with a scheduled action that runs every day at
night, if the response from the `SII (Servicio de
Impuestos Internos)` is needed immediately, you can do it manually as
well by following the `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` status
workflow:

<img src="chile/dte-status-flow.png" class="align-center"
alt="Transition of DTE status flow." />

1.  The first step is to send the
    `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` to the `SII
    (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`. This can be sent manually by
    clicking the `Enviar
    Ahora` button. This generates a `SII Tack number` for the invoice,
    which is used to check the details sent by the
    `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` via email. Then, the
    `DTE status` is updated to `Ask for Status`.

2.  Once the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` response is
    received, Konvergo ERP updates the `DTE status`. To do it manually, click on
    the button `Verify on SII`. The result can either be `Accepted`,
    `Accepted With Objection` or `Rejected`.

    <img src="chile/dte-status-steps.png" class="align-center"
    alt="Identification transaction for invoice and Status update." />

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > There are intermediate statuses in the
    > `SII (Serviciqo de Impuestos Internos)` before acceptance or
    > rejection. It's recommended to **NOT** continuously click
    > `Verify in
    > SII` for smooth processing.
    >
    > <img src="chile/chatter-internal-statuses.png" class="align-center"
    > alt="Electronic invoice data statuses." />

3.  The final response from the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`
    can take on one of these values:

    - `Accepted`: indicates the invoice information is correct, our
      document is now fiscally valid and it's automatically sent to the
      customer.

    - `Accepted with objections`: indicates the invoice information is
      correct, but a minor issue was identified, nevertheless the
      document is now fiscally valid and it's automatically sent to the
      customer.

    - `Rejected`: indicates the invoice information is incorrect and
      must be corrected. Details are sent to emails you registered in
      the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`. If it is properly
      configured in Konvergo ERP, the details are also retrieved in the chatter
      once the email server is processed.

      If the invoice is rejected please follow these steps:

      1.  Change the document to `Draft`.
      2.  Make the required corrections based on the message received
          from the `SII (Servicio
          de Impuestos Internos)` in the chatter.
      3.  Post the invoice again.

      <img src="chile/rejected-invoice.png" class="align-center"
      alt="Message when an invoice is rejected." />

#### Crossed references

When the invoice is created, as a result of another fiscal document, the
information related to the originator document must be registered in the
`Cross-Reference` tab. This tab is commonly used for credit or debit
notes, however, in some cases it can be used for customer invoices, as
well. In the case of the credit and debit notes, they are set
automatically by Konvergo ERP.

<img src="chile/cross-reference-tab-registration.png"
class="align-center" alt="Crossed referenced document(s)." />

#### Invoice PDF report

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` and the PDF is printed, it
includes the fiscal elements that indicate that the document is fiscally
valid.

<img src="chile/sii-validation-elements.png" class="align-center"
alt="SII Validation fiscal elements." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are hosted in Konvergo ERP SH or On-Premise, you should manually
> install the [pdf417gen](https://pypi.org/project/pdf417gen/) library.
> Use the following command to install it: `pip install pdf417gen`.

#### Commercial validation

Once the invoice has been sent to the customer:

1.  `DTE Partner Status` changes to `Sent`.
2.  The customer must send a reception confirmation email.
3.  Subsequently, if commercial terms and invoice data are correct, an
    acceptance confirmation is sent; otherwise, a claim is sent.
4.  The field `DTE Acceptance Status` is updated automatically.

<img src="chile/partner-dte-status.png" class="align-center"
alt="Message with the commercial acceptance from the customer." />

#### Processed for claimed invoices

Once the invoice has been accepted by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`, **it can not be cancelled in
Konvergo ERP**. In case you get a claim for your customer, the correct way to
proceed is with a credit note to either cancel the invoice or correct
it. Please refer to the `chile/credit-notes` section for more details.

<img src="chile/accepted-invoice.png" class="align-center"
alt="Invoice Commercial status updated to claimed." />

#### Common errors

There are multiple reasons behind a rejection from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`, but these are some of the common
errors you might have and how to solve them:

- **Error:** <span class="title-ref">RECHAZO- DTE Sin Comuna
  Origen</span>  
  **Hint:** make sure the company address is properly filled including
  the state and city.

- **Error:** <span class="title-ref">en Monto - IVA debe
  declararse</span>  
  **Hint:** the invoice lines should include one VAT tax, make sure you
  add one on each invoice line.

- **Error:** <span class="title-ref">Rut No Autorizado a Firmar</span>  
  **Hint:** the `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)` entered is not allowed to
  invoice electronically, make sure the company
  `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)` is correct and is valid in the
  `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` to invoice electronically.

- **Error:** <span class="title-ref">Fecha/Número Resolucion Invalido
  RECHAZO- CAF Vencido : (Firma_DTE\[AAAA-MM-DD\] - CAF\[AAAA-MM-DD\])
  &gt; 6 meses</span>  
  **Hint:** try to add a new CAF related to this document as the one
  you're using is expired.

- **Error:** <span class="title-ref">Element
  '{http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutReceptor': This element is not
  expected. Expected is ( {http://www.sii.cl/SiiDte%7DRutEnvia
  ).</span>  
  **Hint:** Make sure the field `Document Type` and `VAT` are set in the
  customer and in the main company.

- **Error:** <span class="title-ref">Usuario sin permiso de
  envio.</span>  
  **Hint:** this error indicates that most likely, your company has not
  passed the [Certification
  process](https://www.sii.cl/factura_electronica/factura_mercado/proceso_certificacion.htm)
  in the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` - Sistema de Facturación
  de Mercado. If this is the case, please contact your Account Manager
  or Customer Support as this certification is not part of the Konvergo ERP
  services, but we can give you some alternatives. If you already passed
  the certification process, this error appears when a user different
  from the owner of the certificate is trying to send
  `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` files to the
  `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`.

- **Error:** <span class="title-ref">CARATULA</span>  
  **Hint:** there are just five reasons why this error could show up and
  all of them are related to the *Caratula* section of the XML:

  > - The company's `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)` number is incorrect or
  >   missing.
  > - The certificate owner `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)` number is
  >   incorrect or missing.
  > - The `SII's (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`
  >   `RUT (Rol Único Tributario)` number (this should be correct by
  >   default) is incorrect or missing.
  > - The resolution date is incorrect or missing.
  > - The resolution number is incorrect or missing.

### Credit notes

When a cancellation or correction is needed over a validated invoice, a
credit note must be generated. It is important to consider that a
`CAF (Folio Authorization Code)` file is required for the credit note,
which is identified as `Document Type` `61` in the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)`. Please refer to the `CAF section
<chile/caf-documentation>` for more information on the process to load
the `CAF (Folio
Authorization Code)` on each document type.

<img src="chile/credit-note-document-type.png" class="align-center"
alt="Creation of CAF for Credit notes." />

#### Use cases

##### Cancel referenced document

In case you need to cancel or invalidate an invoice, navigate to
`Accounting -->
Customers --> Invoices` and select the desired invoice. Then, use the
button `Add Credit
Note` and select `Full Refund`, in this case the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos
Internos)` reference code is automatically set to
`Anula Documento de referencia`.

<img src="chile/credit-note-cancel-ref-doc.png" class="align-center"
alt="Credit note canceling the referenced document." />

##### Correct referenced document

If a correction in the invoice information is required, for example the
street name on the original invoice is wrong, then use the button
`Add Credit Note`, select `Partial Refund` and select the option
`Only Text Correction`. In this case the `SII Reference
Code` field is automatically set to `Corrects Referenced Document Text`.

<img src="chile/credit-note-correct-text.png" class="align-center"
alt="Credit note correcting referenced document text." />

Konvergo ERP creates a credit note with the corrected text in an invoice and
`Price` <span class="title-ref">0.00</span>.

<img src="chile/text-correction-label.png" class="align-center"
alt="Credit note with the corrected value on the invoice lines." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to define the `Default Credit Account` in the sales journal
> specifically for this use case.

##### Corrects referenced document amount

When a correction on the amounts is required, use the button
`Add Credit note` and select `Partial Refund`. In this case the
`SII Reference Code` is automatically set to
`Corrige el monto del Documento de Referencia`.

<img src="chile/credit-note-correct-amount.png" class="align-center"
alt="Credit note for partial refund to correct amounts, using the SII reference code 3." />

### Debit notes

In Chilean localization, debit notes, in addition to credit notes, can
be created using the `Add Debit Note` button, with two main use cases.

#### Use cases

##### Add debt on invoices

The primary use case for debit notes is to increase the value of an
existing invoice. To do so, select option
`3. Corrige el monto del Documento de Referencia` for the
`Reference Code SII` field.

<img src="chile/debit-note-correct-amount.png" class="align-center"
alt="Debit note correcting referenced document amount." />

In this case Konvergo ERP automatically includes the `Source Invoice` in the
`Cross
Reference` tab.

<img src="chile/auto-ref-debit-note.png" class="align-center"
alt="Automatic reference to invoice in a debit note." />

> [!TIP]
> You can only add debit notes to an invoice already accepted by the
> SII.

##### Cancel credit notes

In Chile, debits notes are used to cancel a valid credit note. To do
this, click the `Add

### Vendor bills

As part of the Chilean localization, you can configure your incoming
email server to match the one you have registered in the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` in order to:

- Automatically receive the vendor bills
  `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` and create the vendor bill
  based on this information.
- Automatically send the reception acknowledgement to your vendor.
- Accept or claim the document and send this status to your vendor.

#### Reception

As soon as the vendor email with the attached
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` is received:

1.  The vendor bill maps all the information included in the XML.
2.  An email is sent to the vendor with the reception acknowledgement.
3.  The `DTE Status` is set as `Acuse de Recibido Enviado`.

#### Acceptation

If all the commercial information is correct on your vendor bill, then
you can accept the document using the `Aceptar Documento` button. Once
this is done, the `DTE Acceptation
Status` changes to `Accepted` and an email of acceptance is sent to the
vendor.

<img src="chile/accept-vendor-bill-btn.png" class="align-center"
alt="Button for accepting vendor bills." />

#### Claim

In case there is a commercial issue or the information is not correct on
your vendor bill, you can claim the document before validating it, using
the `Claim` button. Once this is done, the `DTE Acceptation Status`
changes to `Claim` and a rejection email is sent to the vendor.

![Claim button in vendor bills to inform the vendor all the document is commercially
rejected.
:align: center](chile/claim-vendor-bill-btn.png)

If you claim a vendor bill, the status changes from `Draft` to `Cancel`
automatically. Considering this as best practice, all the claimed
documents should be canceled as they won't be valid for your accounting
records.

### Electronic purchase invoice

The *electronic purchase invoice* is a feature included in the
<span class="title-ref">l10n_cl_edi</span> module.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>` (e.g., uploading a
valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.), the electronic
purchase invoices need their own `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`.
Please refer to the `CAF documentation <chile/caf-documentation>` to
check the details on how to acquire the
`CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)` for electronic purchase invoices.

Electronic purchase invoices are useful when vendors are not obligated
to expedite an electronic vendor bill for your purchase. Still, your
obligations require a document to be sent to the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` as proof of purchase.

#### Configuration

To generate an electronic purchase invoice from a vendor bill, the bill
must be created in a purchase journal with the *Use Documents* feature
enabled. It is possible to modify an existing purchase journal or create
a new one in the following process.

To modify the existing purchase journal, or create a new purchase
journal, navigate to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Journals`. Then,
click the `New` button, and fill in the following required information:

- `Type`: select `Purchase` from the drop-down menu for vendor bill
  journals.
- `Use Documents`: check this field so the journal can generate
  electronic documents (in this case the electronic purchase invoice).

#### Generate an electronic purchase invoice

To generate this type of document, it is necessary to create a vendor
bill in Konvergo ERP. To do so, navigate to `Accounting --> Vendors --> Bills`,
and click the `New` button.

When all of the electronic purchase invoice information is filled,
select the option `(46)
Electronic Purchase Invoice` in the `Document Type` field:

After the vendor bill is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` file (Electronic Tax
  Document) is automatically created and added to the chatter.
- The `DTE SII Status` is set as `Pending to be sent`.

Konvergo ERP automatically updates the *DTE Status* every night using a
scheduled action. To get a response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` immediately, click the
`Send now to
SII` button.

### Delivery guide

To install the `Delivery Guide` module, go to `Apps` and search for
<span class="title-ref">Chile (l10n_cl)</span>. Then click `Install` on
the module `Chile - E-Invoicing Delivery
Guide`.

> [!NOTE]
> `Chile - E-Invoicing Delivery Guide` has a dependency with `Chile -
> Facturación Electrónica`. Konvergo ERP will install the dependency
> automatically when the `Delivery Guide` module is installed.

The *Delivery Guide* module includes the ability to send the
`DTE (Documentos Tributarios
Electrónicos)` to `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` and the stamp
in PDF reports for deliveries.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>` (e.g., uploading a
valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.), delivery
guides need their own `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`. Please refer to
the `CAF documentation
<chile/caf-documentation>` to check the details on how to acquire the
`CAF (Folio
Authorization Code)` for electronic Delivery Guides.

Verify the following important information in the
`Price for the Delivery Guide` configuration:

- `From Sales Order`: delivery guide takes the product price from the
  sales order and shows it on the document.
- `From Product Template`: Konvergo ERP takes the price configured in the
  product template and shows it on the document.
- `No show price`: no price is shown in the delivery guide.

Electronic delivery guides are used to move stock from one place to
another and they can represent sales, sampling, consignment, internal
transfers, and basically any product move.

#### Delivery guide from a sales process

> [!WARNING]
> A delivery guide should **not** be longer than one page or contain
> more than 60 product lines.

When a sales order is created and confirmed, a delivery order is
generated. After validating the delivery order, the option to create a
delivery guide is activated.

<img src="chile/delivery-guide-creation-btn.png" class="align-center"
alt="Create Delivery Guide button on a sales process." />

> [!WARNING]
> When clicking on `Create Delivery Guide` for the first time, a warning
> message pops up, stating the following:
>
> <span class="title-ref">No se encontró una secuencia para la guía de
> despacho. Por favor, establezca el primer número dentro del campo
> número para la guía de despacho</span>
>
> <img src="chile/delivery-guide-number-warning.png" class="align-center"
> alt="First Delivery Guide number warning message." />

This warning message means the user needs to indicate the next sequence
number Konvergo ERP has to take to generate the delivery guide (e.g. next
available `CAF (Folio Authorization Code)` number), and only happens the
first time a delivery guide is created in Konvergo ERP. After the first document
has been correctly generated, Konvergo ERP takes the next available number in
the `CAF (Folio Authorization
Code)` file to generate the following delivery guide.

After the delivery guide is created:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` file (Electronic Tax
  Document) is automatically created and added to the `chatter`.
- The `DTE SII Status` is set as `Pending to be sent`.

<img src="chile/chatter-delivery-guide.png" class="align-center"
alt="Chatter notes of Delivery Guide creation." />

The `DTE Status` is automatically updated by Konvergo ERP with a scheduled
action that runs every night. To get a response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` immediately, press the
`Send now to SII` button.

Once the delivery guide is sent, it may then be printed by clicking on
the `Print Delivery
Guide` button.

<img src="chile/print-delivery-guide-btn.png" class="align-center"
alt="Printing Delivery Guide PDF." />

Delivery guide will have fiscal elements that indicate that the document
is fiscally valid when printed (if hosted in *Konvergo ERP SH* or on
*On-premise* remember to manually add the `pdf417gen` library mentioned
in the `Invoice PDF report section
<chile/electronic-invoice-pdf-report>`).

### Electronic receipt

To install the `Electronic Receipt` module, go to `Apps` and search for
<span class="title-ref">Chile (l10n_cl)</span>. Then click `Install` on
the module `Chile - Electronic
Receipt`.

> [!NOTE]
> `Chile - Electronic Receipt` has a dependency with
> `Chile - Facturación
> Electrónica`. Konvergo ERP will install the dependency automatically when the
> `E-invoicing
> Delivery Guide` module is installed.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>` (e.g., uploading a
valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.), electronic
receipts need their own `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`. Please refer
to the `CAF documentation
<chile/caf-documentation>` to check the details on how to acquire the
`CAFs (Folio
Authorization Code)` for electronic receipts.

Electronic receipts are useful when clients do not need an electronic
invoice. By default, there is a partner in the database called
`Anonymous Final Consumer` with a generic `RUT (Rol
Único Tributario)` <span class="title-ref">66666666-6</span> and
taxpayer type of `Final Consumer`. This partner can be used for
electronic receipts or a new record may be created for the same purpose.

<img src="chile/electronic-receipt-customer.png" class="align-center"
alt="Electronic Receipt module." />

Although electronic receipts should be used for final consumers with a
generic `RUT (Rol Único
Tributario)`, it can also be used for specific partners. After the
partners and journals are created and configured, the electronic
receipts are created in the standard way as electronic invoice, but the
type of document `(39) Electronic Receipt` should be selected in the
invoice form:

<img src="chile/document-type-39.png" class="align-center"
alt="Document type 39 for Electronic Receipts." />

#### Validation and DTE status

When all of the electronic receipt information is filled, manually (or
automatically) proceed to validate the receipt from the sales order. By
default, `Electronic Invoice` is selected as the `Document Type`,
however in order to validate the receipt correctly, make sure to edit
the `Document Type` and change to `Electronic Receipt`.

After the receipt is posted:

- The `DTE (Documentos Tributarios Electrónicos)` file (Electronic Tax
  Document) is created automatically and added to the `chatter`.
- The `DTE SII Status` is set as `Pending to be sent`.

<img src="chile/electronic-receipt-ste-status.png" class="align-center"
alt="Electronic Receipts STE creation status." />

The `DTE Status` is automatically updated by Konvergo ERP with a scheduled
action that runs every day at night. To get a response from the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` immediately, press the
`Send now to SII` button.

Please refer to the `DTE Workflow <chile/electronic-invoice-validation>`
for electronic invoices as the workflow for electronic receipt follows
the same process.

### Electronic export of goods

To install the `Electronic Exports of Goods` module, go to `Apps` and
search for <span class="title-ref">Chile (l10n_cl)</span>. Then click
`Install` on the module `Electronic
Exports of Goods for Chile`.

> [!NOTE]
> `Chile - Electronic Exports of Goods for Chile` has a dependency with
> `Chile
> - Facturación Electrónica`.

Once all configurations have been made for
`electronic invoices <chile/electronic-invoice>` (e.g., uploading a
valid company certificate, setting up master data, etc.), electronic
exports of goods need their own `CAFs (Folio Authorization Code)`.
Please refer to the `CAF
documentation <chile/caf-documentation>` to check the details on how to
acquire the `CAFs
(Folio Authorization Code)` for electronic receipts.

Electronic invoices for the export of goods are tax documents that are
used not only for the `SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` but are
also used with customs and contain the information required by it.

#### Contact configurations

<img src="chile/taxpayer-type-export-goods.png" class="align-center"
alt="Taxpayer Type needed for the Electronic Exports of Goods module." />

#### Chilean customs

When creating an electronic exports of goods invoice, these new fields
in the `Other Info` tab are required to comply with Chilean regulations.

<img src="chile/chilean-custom-fields.png" class="align-center"
alt="Chilean customs fields." />

#### PDF report

Once the invoice is accepted and validated by the
`SII (Servicio de Impuestos Internos)` and the PDF is printed, it
includes the fiscal elements that indicate that the document is fiscally
valid and a new section needed for customs.
