# Fiscal localizations

## Fiscal localization packages

**Fiscal Localization Packages** are country-specific modules that
install pre-configured taxes, fiscal positions, chart of accounts, and
legal statements on your database. Some additional features, such as the
configuration of specific certificates, are also added to your
Accounting app, following your fiscal administration requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Odoo continuously adds new localizations and improves the existing
> packages.

### Configuration

Odoo automatically installs the appropriate package for your company,
according to the country selected at the creation of the database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As long as you haven't posted any entry, you can still add and select
> another package.

To install a new package, go to `Accounting --> Configuration --> Fiscal
Localization`, click on **Install More Packages**, and install your
country's module.

country-specific statements and certifications.
