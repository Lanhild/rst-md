# Email marketing

Emails are an effective, fully-customizable form of communication that
are able to reach any target audience - large or small. The success of
an email is easily measurable, especially when a creative call-to-action
is involved.

Konvergo ERP *Email Marketing* provides professional-grade email design tools,
templates, and features, designed to simplify the otherwise complex
process required to create engaging emails, build successful campaigns,
and track their overall effectiveness in a single application.

## Email marketing dashboard

To get started, click on the `Email Marketing` app icon, located on the
main Konvergo ERP dashboard, which leads to the main `Email Marketing` dashboard
(in the default kanban view).

To see all the mailings in the database, remove the default
`My Mailings` filter from the search bar.

<img src="email_marketing/dashboard.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the main dashboard of the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

> [!NOTE]
> In the search bar, by default, the filter: `My Mailings` is present.
> That means the only information being seen (at that time) on the
> `Email Marketing` dashboard are emails that the current user has
> created, sent, or is responsible for.
>
> This filter can be removed by clicking the `X` next to `My Mailings`
> in the search bar. Doing so, reveals all the information for every
> email in the database.

### Default kanban view and stages

The four kanban columns each represent the various stages of emails that
have been built or sent within the *Email Marketing* application.

The stages are: `Draft`, `In Queue`, `Sending`, `Sent`.

- `Draft`: means the email is still being written/created.
- `In Queue`: means the email is scheduled, and sent at a later date.
- `Sending`: means the email is currently being sent to its recipients.
- `Sent`: means the email has already been sent to its recipients.

In each stage, there are drag-and-drop cards representing the email
campaigns that have been created, and the stage they are in represents
the current status of that mailing.

Each mailing block on the `Email Marketing` dashboard provides key
information related to that specific email.

When the cursor hovers over the upper-right corner of an email campaign
card, three vertical dots (`⋮`) appear. When clicked, a mini drop-down
menu reveals the option to color-code the email `Delete` the email
altogether, or `Archive` the message for potential future use.

<img src="email_marketing/three-dot-dropdown.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the three-dot drop-down menu on the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing dashboard." />

In the upper-right corner of the main `Email Marketing` dashboard, there
are other view options to choose from: `List` and `Graph`.

### List view

The `List` view (represented by the `☰ (three vertical lines)` icon)
provides the same key information, but in a classic list format.

<img src="email_marketing/list-view.png" class="align-center"
alt="How the List view appears in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

### Graph view

The `Graph` view (represented by the `📊 (bar graph)` icon) provides the
same key information, but in a variety of customizable graph (and chart)
layouts.

<img src="email_marketing/graph-view.png" class="align-center"
alt="How the Graph view appears in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

In the upper-left corner, there is a `Measures` menu, providing even
more filter options to further customize the graph views.

Those `Measures` options are: `A/B Testing percentage`, `Color Index`,
and `Count` (which is selected, by default).

### Filters, Group By, and Favorites search options

Regardless of the view chosen for the `Email Marketing` dashboard, the
`Filters`, `Group by`, and `Favorites` options are always available.

These options provide various ways to specify and organize the
information seen on the `Email Marketing` dashboard.

<div class="tabs">

<div class="tab">

Filters

This drop-down menu provides different ways to filter email campaigns on
the dashboard. The options are: `My Mailings`, `Sent Date`, `Archived`,
and `Add Custom Filter`. If `Add Custom Filter` is selected, Konvergo ERP
reveals an additional drop-down menu, with three customizable fields to
fill in, in order to retrieve results that fit more specific criteria.

![View of filters drop-down menu options on the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing dashboard.](email_marketing/filters-dropdown.png)

</div>

<div class="tab">

Group By

This drop-down menu provides additional ways to organize the data on the
dashboard by grouping them in specific ways. Using this drop-down menu,
the data can be grouped by the messages' `Status`, or who it was
`Sent By`.

There is also the option to group the data by `Sent Period`, which has
its own sub-menu of options to choose from. The `Sent Period` options
are `Year`, `Quarter`, `Month`, `Week`, and `Day`.

If none of the above `Group By` options deliver the desired results,
click `Add Custom Group` at the bottom of the drop-down menu. Doing so
reveals a new field, wherein custom criteria can be selected and
applied, thus delivering any grouping of data that may be desired.

![View of the Group By drop-down menu on the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application.](email_marketing/group-by-dropdown.png)

</div>

<div class="tab">

Favorites

This drop-down menu provides different ways to incorporate past search
filters and other record-related options to customize the dashboard. The
options are: `Save current
search`, `Import records`, `Add to my dashboard`, and `Add to
Google Spreadsheet`.

</div>

</div>

## Settings

To view (and modify) the *Email Marketing* settings, navigate to
`Email Marketing
application --> Configuration --> Settings`.

<img src="email_marketing/settings-page.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the Settings page in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

On this `Settings` page, there are three features available. The
features are: `Mailing Campaigns`,
`Blacklist Option when Unsubscribing`, and `Dedicated Server`.

- `Mailing Campaigns`: enables the option to manage mass mailing
  campaigns.
- `Blacklist Option when Unsubscribing`: allows recipients to blacklist
  themselves from future mailings during the unsubscribing process.
- `Dedicated Server`: provides the option to utilize a separate,
  dedicated server for mailings. When enabled, Konvergo ERP reveals a new field
  (and link), in which the specific server configurations must be
  entered, in order for it to connect properly to Konvergo ERP.

## Create an email

To create an email, open the `Email Marketing` application, and click
the `Create` button in the upper-left corner.

Clicking `Create` reveals a blank email detail form.

<img src="email_marketing/blank-email-detail-form.png"
class="align-center"
alt="View of a blank email detail form in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

First, enter a `Subject` to the email. The `Subject` is visible in the
recipients' inbox, allowing them to get quickly see what the message is
about.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Subject` field is mandatory. An email can not be sent without a
> `Subject`.

> [!TIP]
> The `☺ (smiley face)` icon at the end of the `Subject` field (and
> `Preview Text` field) represents emojis. Click that `☺ (smiley face)`
> icon to reveal a menu of emojis that can be used in either field.

Next, there is the option to enter some `Preview Text`. This text is a
catchy preview sentence that encourages recipients to open the message.
In most inboxes, this is displayed next to the subject.

> [!TIP]
> Keep the `Preview Text` empty to show the first characters of the
> email content, instead.

### Recipients

After that, it's time to choose the recipients of this email, which can
be completed in the `Recipients` field.

<img src="email_marketing/recipients-dropdown.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of recipients drop-down menu in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

The default option is `Mailing List`. If `Mailing List` option is
selected, a specific `Mailing List` needs to be chosen from the adjacent
`Select mailing
lists` field drop-down menu.

Then, Konvergo ERP will only send this email to contacts on that specific
mailing list.

<div class="seealso">

`/applications/marketing/email_marketing/mailing_lists`

</div>

When the `Recipients` field is clicked, a drop-down menu of other
options is revealed. Each option provides different ways Konvergo ERP can create
a target audience for the email.

Those options (excluding the default `Mailing List`) provide the option
to create a more specified recipient filter, in an equation-like format.

The `Recipients` field options are as follows:

- `Applicant`: filter focuses on specific job applicants in the
  database.
- `Contact`: filter focuses on specific contacts in the database.
- `Event Registration`: filter focuses on people in the database who
  purchased event registrations.
- `Event Track`: filter focuses on people in the database who hosted a
  specific talk (track) at an event.
- `Lead/Opportunity`: filter focuses on leads or opportunities in the
  database.
- `Mailing Contact`: filter focuses on specific mailing contacts in the
  database.
- `Sales Order`: filter focuses on a specific sales orders in the
  database.

If the specified recipient fields don't automatically reveal themselves,
simply click the `Add Filter` button beneath the `Recipients` field, and
Konvergo ERP reveals the necessary equation fields to further drill down the
target recipients for this mailing.

### Add a recipient filter

To add a more specified recipient filter, select any recipient option
(other than `Mailing
List`), and clicking `Add Filter`, if needed, to reveal three fields,
formatted like an equation.

To reveal the sub-menu options, click each field, and make the desired
selections, until the preferred configuration has been achieved. The
number of `Records` that match the rule(s) are indicated to the right of
the `Recipients` field, in green.

<img src="email_marketing/add-filter-button.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of how recipient filters can be customized in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing." />

> [!NOTE]
> Some sub-menu options in the first rule field allow for a second
> choice to provide even more specificity.

To the right of each rule, are `× (Delete node)`, `＋ (Add node)`, and
`⋯ (Add branch)` icons.

The `× (Delete node)` icon deletes a specific node (line) of the rule.
The `＋
(Add node)` icon adds a node (line) to the rule. And, the
`⋯ (Add branch)` icon adds a branch to the node. A branch means two
additional, indented sub-nodes are added to the rule, providing even
more specificity to the line above it.

### Mail body tab

At the bottom of the email form are two tabs: `Mail Body` and
`Settings`. Let's focus on `Mail Body` tab first.

In the `Mail Body` tab, there are a number of pre-configured message
templates to choose from. Select the desired template, and modify every
element of its design details with Konvergo ERP's drag-and-drop building blocks,
located on the right sidebar. Each building block provides unique
features and professional design elements.

<img src="email_marketing/mail-blocks.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the building blocks used to create mailings in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

> [!TIP]
> To build an email from scratch, select the `Plain Text` template, and
> Konvergo ERP provides a blank email canvas, which can be customized in a
> number of ways - either by using the front-end rich text editor that
> accepts slash (`/`) commands, or with the XML code editor when
> `Developer Mode (debug mode) <developer-mode>` is engaged, and the
> `</>` icon is clicked.

### Settings tab

To the right of the `Mail Body` tab is the `Settings` tab.

> [!NOTE]
> The options available in the `Settings` tab will be different,
> depending on if the `Mailing Campaigns` feature is activated in the
> `Settings` page of the `Email Marketing` application
> (`Email Marketing --> Configuration
> --> Settings`).

Without the `Mailing Campaigns` feature activated, the `Settings` tab on
the email detail form looks like this:

<img src="email_marketing/settings-without-features.png"
class="align-center"
alt="View of settings tab in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing app, without settings activated." />

- `Responsible`: choose an employee (in the database) to be responsible
  for this particular email.
- `Send From`: designate an email alias that'll display as the sender of
  this particular email.
- `Reply To`: designate an email alias to whom all the replies to this
  particular email will be sent.
- `Attachments`: if any specific documents are required (or helpful) for
  this event invite, they can be sent along with this email, by clicking
  `ATTACH A FILE`, and adding the appropriate document(s).

When the `Mailing Campaigns` feature *is* activated, additional
`Marketing` options appear in the `Settings` tab, which look like this:

<img src="email_marketing/settings-tab-with-settings.png"
class="align-center"
alt="View of settings tab in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing when settings are activated." />

The additional features are: `Mailing Campaign`, `Allow A/B Testing`,
and `A/B Testing percentage`.

## Mailing campaigns

The `Mailing Campaign` field provides the option to add this particular
email to a previously-made email campaign in the database. Click the
empty field to reveal a drop-down menu containing all previously-made
mailing campaigns in the database.

<img src="email_marketing/mailing-campaign-dropdown.png"
class="align-center"
alt="View of a mailing campaign drop-down menu in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

If the desired campaign isn't available in the initial drop-down menu,
select `Search
More` to reveal a complete list of all mailing campaigns in the
database. Or, type the name of the desired mailing campaign in the
`Mailing Campaign` field, until Konvergo ERP reveals the desired campaign in the
drop-down menu. Then, select the desired campaign.

### Create new mailing campaign (from Settings tab)

To create a new campaign from this `Mailing Campaign` field, start
typing the name of this new campaign, and select
`Create [Campaign Name]` or `Create and Edit...`.

Click `Create` to add this new mailing campaign to the database, and
modify its settings in the future. And click `Create and Edit...` to add
this new mailing campaign to the database, and Konvergo ERP reveals a pop-up
window.

<img src="email_marketing/mailing-campaign-popup.png"
class="align-center"
alt="View of the email mailing campaign pop-up window in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

Here, the new mailing campaign can be further customized. Adjust the
`Campaign Name`, assign a `Responsible`, and add `Tags`.

The top row of the `Create: Mailing Campaign` pop-up window is filled
with analytical smart buttons. Each of which displays various metrics
related to the campaign. When clicked, Konvergo ERP reveals a separate, more
detailed page with even more in-depth statistics.

The option to instantly a new communication from this pop-up window is
available in the upper-left corner. The adjustable status bar is located
in the upper-right.

When all modifications are ready to be finalized, click `Save`. To
delete the entire campaign, click `Discard`.

### Create new mailing campaign (from Campaigns page)

When the `Mailing Campaigns` feature is activated, a new `Campaigns`
option appears in the header of the *Email Marketing* application.
Campaigns can also be created on this `Campaigns` page in the *Email
Marketing* app.

To do that, navigate to `Email Marketing app --> Campaigns --> Create`.
When that's clicked, a pop-up window appears, in which the
`Campaign Name`, `Responsible`, and `Tags` can be added directly on the
`Campaigns` dashboard.

<img src="email_marketing/campaigns-page-popup.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the campaign pop-up window in Konvergo ERP Email Marketing." />

Click `Add` to add the campaign to the database, and freely edit it
later on. Or, click `Edit` and Konvergo ERP reveals the campaign template form
on a separate page, providing the opportunity to further edit the
campaign, send communications related to the campaign, and analyze
various metrics related to the campaign, via the smart buttons at the
top of the form.

## A/B testing

Back in the `Settings` tab of the mailing, if the `Allow A/B Testing`
box is checked, recipients are only be mailed to once. This allows
different mailings to be sent to randomly selected recipients. This
tests the overall effectiveness of the mailing, and eliminates the need
for duplicate messages.

The `A/B Testing percentage` field represents the percentage of contacts
in the database that this message will be mailed to, as a part of the
`A/B Testing`. Enter a number between
<span class="title-ref">1-100</span>. The recipients are randomly
chosen.

## Send, schedule, or test

After finalizing the mailing, Konvergo ERP provides the following options in the
upper-left corner of the email template page. Those options are: `Send`,
`Schedule`, and `Test`.

While in `Edit` mode, there are also buttons to `Save` or `Discard` the
mailing, as well.

- `Send` - Click to have Konvergo ERP send the email to the desired recipients.
  When Konvergo ERP has sent the mailing, the status changes to *Sent*.
- `Schedule` - Click to reveal a pop-up window, in which a future
  date-time is chosen. Konvergo ERP sends the mailing to the desired recipients
  at that specified date-time. When a date-time is chosen, the status of
  the mailing changes to *In Queue*.
- `Test` - Click to reveal a pop-up window, in which Konvergo ERP allows a
  sample email to be sent for testing purposes. Enter the desired
  recipient's email address in the `Recipients` field, and click
  `Send Sample Mail`.
- `Save` - Click to save the mailing as a draft, which can be edited
  (and sent) at a later date. When clicked, the status of the mailing
  stays as `Draft`.
- `Discard` - Click to discard any changes that have been made since the
  last save.

> [!TIP]
> When `Save` or `Discard` is selected (while in `Edit` mode), those
> options are replaced with an `Edit` button and a `Create` button.
> Click `Edit` to re-enter `Edit` mode. Click `Create` to start creating
> a new mailing.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, there's a daily limit applied for **all emails** sent
> throughout *all* applications. So, if there are remaining emails to be
> sent after a limit has been reached, those mailings *will not* be sent
> automatically the next day. The sending needs to be forced, by opening
> the email and clicking `Retry`.
