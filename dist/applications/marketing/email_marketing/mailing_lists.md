# Mailing lists

Mailing lists are important for a number of reasons. Mailing lists can
provide valuable leads for sales teams, communicate with focus groups
participants, contact consumers directly for useful feedback, and more.

## Create mailing lists

To create a mailing list in the *Email Marketing* application, navigate
to `Mailing
lists --> Mailing lists --> Create`. Clicking `Create` reveals a pop-up
window.

alt="View of the mailing list pop-up in the Konvergo ERP Email Marketing application." />

In the pop-up, name the mailing list and designate if the mailing list
should be public with the `Is Public` checkbox.

The `Is Public` option allows the mailing list to be accessible by
recipients in the unsubscription page, making it possible for them to
update their subscription preferences.

After those options have been configured, click `Create` to create the
mailing list, which Konvergo ERP automatically adds to the `Mailing Lists` page.

## Add contacts to a mailing list

After a mailing list has been created (and added to the `Mailing Lists`
dashboard), click on the desired mailing list to add contacts to the
list.

Clicking the desired mailing list reveals a separate
`Mailing List Contacts` page, in which contacts can be added to this
specific list by clicking `Create`, and adding contact information
directly on a separate contact detail form.

Or, while in the `Email Marketing` application, navigate to `Mailing
Lists --> Mailing List Contacts`. Doing so reveals a separate page with
all the mailing list contacts in the database.

From here, click `Create`, and add a contact with the same previous
steps. Or, click the `Import` icon (to the right of the `Create` button)
to import contacts into the database.

Once contacts are in the database, click into the desired contact's
detail form, and add the preferred mailing list in the `Mailing List`
tab (at the bottom of the contact detail form), by clicking
`Add a line`, and selecting the desired mailing list. Multiple mailing
lists can be added to a single contact's detail form.

### Create new mailing list from contact detail form

To create a mailing list from a contact detail form, click `Add a line`,
and type in the name of a new mailing list in the empty field that
appears. Then, select either `Create` or `Create and Edit...`.

The `Create` option quickly creates the mailing list to the contact
detail form, and the list can be configured at a later date. The
`Create and Edit...` option creates the mailing list, and reveals a
pop-up window, in which the new mailing list can be configured right
away.

## Link a mailing list to website (Newsletter blocks)

When a mailing list is created in the database, Konvergo ERP provides the option
to directly link the mailing list on the Konvergo ERP-built website (created via
Konvergo ERP's `Website` application).

To link a mailing list to a website, navigate to the front-end of the
website, and enter `Edit` mode by clicking `Edit` in the upper-right
corner. When clicked, Konvergo ERP reveals a right-sidebar, filled with
drag-and-drop *Building Blocks* that are packed with various features,
options, and design elements.

Then, to add a *subscription field* for a specific mailing list onto a
website, drag-and-drop any of the `Newsletter` options
(`Newsletter Block`, `Newsletter Popup`, or `Newsletter`).

> [!TIP]
> To quickly locate the `Newsletter` building block options (while in
> `Edit` mode on the front-end of the website), type
> <span class="title-ref">Newsletter</span> into the search bar, located
> in the right sidebar, under the `Blocks` tab, and Konvergo ERP reveals the
> three different `Newsletter` block options.

When a `Newsletter` block is dragged onto the body of the website, Konvergo ERP
reveals a pop-up window, in which the desired mailing list is selected
from a drop-down menu (and linked) to this block on the website.

- `Newsletter Block` - Adds a block onto the webpage, providing visitors
  with the option to add their email address to this mailing list, and
  subscribe to future communications.

  Here's an example of a `Newsletter Block`.

- `Newsletter Popup` - Tells Konvergo ERP to reveal a subscription pop-up window
  to occur at a certain part of the webpage. When the visitor scrolls to
  this predetermined point, a pop-up subscription window appears, asking
  for their email address to subscribe to the mailing list. The pop-up
  window can be edited further to fit any business needs.

  Here's an example of a `Newsletter Popup`.

- `Newsletter` - Provides visitors with a simple field to add their
  email address to the mailing list, and subscribe to future mailings in
  the footer (or anywhere else on the page).

  Here's an example of a `Newsletter` dynamic block.
