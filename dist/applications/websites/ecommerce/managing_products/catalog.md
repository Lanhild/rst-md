# Catalog

The eCommerce catalog is the equivalent of your physical store shelves:
it allows customers to see what you have to offer. Clear categories,
available options, sorting, and navigation threads help you structure it
efficiently.

## Categorize the product catalog

In Konvergo ERP, there is a **specific category model** for your eCommerce.
Using eCommerce categories for your products allows you to add a
navigation menu on your eCommerce page. Visitors can then use it to view
all products under the category they select.

To do so, go to `Website --> eCommerce --> Products`, select the product
you wish to modify, click on the `Sales` tab, and select the
`Categories` you want under `eCommerce Shop`.

alt="eCommerce categories under the &quot;Sales&quot; tab" />

> [!NOTE]
> A single product can appear under multiple eCommerce categories.

When your product's categories are configured, go to your **main shop
page** and click on `Edit --> Customize tab`. In the `Categories`
option, you can either enable a menu on the `Left`, on the `Top`, or
both. If you select the `Left` category, the option
`Collapsable Category Recursive` appears and allows to render the `Left`
category menu collapsable.

### Browsing

The eCommerce category is the first tool to organize and split your
products. However, if you need an extra level of categorization in your
catalog, you can activate various **filters** such as attributes or
sort-by search.

#### Attributes

Attributes refer to **characteristics** of a product, such as **color**
or **material**, whereas variants are the different combinations of
attributes. `Attributes and Variants` can be found under
`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`, select your product, and
`Attributes & Variants` tab.

<div class="seealso">

\- `../../../sales/sales/products_prices/products/variants`

</div>

<img src="catalog/catalog-attributes.png" class="align-center"
alt="Attributes and variants of your product" />

To enable **attribute filtering**, go to your **main shop page**, click
on `Edit -->
Customize tab` and select either `Left`, `Top`, or both. Additionally,
you can also enable `Price Filtering` to enable price filters.

> [!NOTE]
> `Price Filter` works independently from **attributes** and, therefore,
> can be enabled on its own if desired.

> [!TIP]
> You can use **attribute filters** even if you do not work with product
> variants. When adding attributes to your products, make sure only to
> specify *one* value per attribute. Konvergo ERP does not create variants if no
> combination is possible.

#### Sort-by search

It is possible to allow the user to manually **sort the catalog** using
the search bar. From your **main shop page**, click on
`Edit --> Customize tab`; you can enable or disable the `Sort-By` option
as well as the `Layout` button. You can also select the `Default Sort`
of the `Sort-By` button. The default sort applies to *all* categories.

The **sorting** options are:

- Featured
- Newest Arrivals
- Name (A-Z)
- Price - Low to High
- Price - High to Low

In addition, you can **manually edit** the catalog's order of a product
by going to **the main shop page** and clicking on the product. Under
the `Product` section of the `Customize` section, you can rearrange the
order by clicking on the arrows. <span class="title-ref">\<\<</span>
<span class="title-ref">\>\></span> move the product to the **extreme**
right or left, and <span class="title-ref">\<</span>
<span class="title-ref">\></span> move the product by **one** row to the
right or left. It is also possible to change the catalog's order of
products in `Website --> eCommerce --> Products` and drag-and-dropping
the products within the list.

## Page design

### Category page

You can customize the layout of the category page using the website
builder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Editing the layout of the category page is global; editing one
> category layout affects *all* category pages.

To do so, go on to your `Category page --> Edit --> Customize`. Here,
you can choose the layout, the number of columns to display the
products, etc. The `Product Description` button makes the product
description visible from the category page, underneath the product
picture.

<img src="catalog/catalog-category-layout.png" class="align-center"
alt="Layout options of the category pages." />

> [!TIP]
> You can choose the size of the grid, but be aware that displaying too
> many products may affect performance and page loading speed.

### Product highlight

You can highlight products to make them more visible on the category or
product page. On the page of your choice, go to `Edit --> Customize` and
click on the product to highlight. In the `Product` section, you can
choose the size of the product image by clicking on the grid, and you
can also add a **ribbon** or `Badge`. This displays a banner across the
product's image, such as:

- Sale;
- Sold out;
- Out of stock;
- New.

Alternatively, you can activate the
`developer mode <../../../general/developer_mode>` on the **product's
template**, and under the `Sales` tab, change or create the ribbon from
the `Ribbon` field.

> [!NOTE]
> The `developer mode <../../../general/developer_mode>` is only
> intended for experienced users who wish to have access to advanced
> tools. Using the **developer mode** is *not* recommended for regular
> users.

## Additional features

You can access and enable additional feature buttons such as **add to
cart**, **comparison list**, or a **wishlist**. To do so, go to your
**main shop page**, and at the end of the `Products Page` category,
click on the feature buttons you wish to use. All three buttons appear
when hovering the mouse over a product's image.

- `Add to Cart`: adds a button to
  `add the product to the cart <../checkout_payment_shipping/cart>`;
- `Comparison List`: adds a button to **compare** products based on
  their price, variant, etc.;
- `Wishlist Button`: adds a button to **wishlist** the product.

alt="Feature buttons for add to cart, comparison list, and wishlist" />

alt="Appearance of buttons when hoovering over the mouse" />

## Add content

You can use **building blocks** to add content on the category page,
with a variety of blocks ranging from `Structure` to `Dynamic Content`.
Specific areas are defined to use blocks are defined and highlighted on
the page when **dragging-and-dropping** a block.

<img src="catalog/catalog-content.png" class="align-center"
alt="Building blocks areas" />

- If you drop a building block **on top** of the product list, it
  creates a new category header specific to *that* category.
- If you drop a building **on the top** or **bottom** of the page, it
  becomes visible on *all* category pages.

> [!TIP]
> Adding content to an eCommerce category page is beneficial in terms of
> **SEO** strategy. Using **keywords** linked to the products or the
> eCommerce categories improves organic traffic. Additionally, each
> category has its own specific URL that can be pointed to and is
> indexed by search engines.
