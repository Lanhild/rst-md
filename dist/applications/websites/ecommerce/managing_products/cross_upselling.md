# Cross-selling and upselling

Any sales process is an opportunity to maximize revenues.
**Cross-selling and upselling** are sales techniques consisting in
selling customers additional or more expensive products and services
than what they were originally shopping for. It is a great way to
maximize the value of each one of your customers.

**Cross-selling** can be done via **two** features:

- `Optional products <cross_upselling/optional>` upon **adding to
  cart**;
- `Accessory products <cross_upselling/accessory>` on the **checkout
  page**.

**Upselling** is only done via
`alternative products <cross_upselling/alternative>` on the **product
page**.

## Cross-selling

### Optional products

**Optional products** are suggested when customers click `Add to cart`,
either from the **product page** or **catalog page**. Upon clicking, a
pop-up window opens with the **optional products** displayed in the
`Available Options` section.

`Optional Products` field. Optional products are **linked** to the
product(s) they are set up with on the **product template**. They only
appear when that product is added to the cart.
