# Pages

Konvergo ERP allows you to create pages for your website and customize their
content and appearance to your needs.

<div id="website/page_type">

**Static** pages have stable content, such as the homepage. You can
manually create new ones, define their URLs, adapt their
`properties <website/page_properties>`, etc. **Dynamic** pages, on the
other hand, are generated dynamically. All pages generated automatically
by Konvergo ERP, for example, when you install an app or module (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">/shop</span> or
<span class="title-ref">/blog</span>) or publish a new product or blog
post, are dynamic pages and are therefore managed differently.

</div>

## Page creation

Website pages can be created from the **frontend** and the **backend**.
To create a new website page, proceed as follows:

> 1.  - Either open the **Website** app, click `+ New` in the top-right
>       corner, then select `Page`;
>     - Or go to `Website --> Site --> Pages` and click `New`.
> 2.  Enter a `Page Title`; this title is used in the menu and the
>     page's URL.
> 3.  Click `Create`.
> 4.  Customize the page's content and appearance using the website
>     builder, then click `Save`.
> 5.  `Publish <website/un-publish-page>` the page.

> [!NOTE]
> Disable `Add to menu` if the page should not appear in the menu.

## Page management

### Publishing/unpublishing pages

Pages need to be published to make them accessible to website visitors.
To publish or unpublish a page, access it and toggle the switch in the
upper-right corner from `Unpublished` to `Published`, or vice versa.

![Unpublished/Published toggle](pages/un-published_toggle.png)

> [!NOTE]
> It is also possible to:
>
> - publish/unpublish a page from the
>   `page properties <website/page_properties>`, where you can define a
>   publishing date and/or restrict the page's visibility if needed;
> - publish/unpublish several pages at once: go to
>   `Website --> Site --> Pages`, select the pages, then click `Action`
>   and select `Publish` or `Unpublish`.

### Homepage

When you create a website, Konvergo ERP creates a dedicated `Home` page by
default, but you can define any website page as your homepage. To do so,
go to `Website --> Configuration
--> Settings`, then, in the `Website info` section, define the URL of
the desired page in the field `Homepage URL` (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">/shop</span>).

Alternatively, you can define any `static page <website/page_type>` as
your homepage by going to `Website --> Site --> Properties`. Select the
`Publish` tab and enable `Use as Homepage`.

### Page properties

To modify a `static page's <website/page_type>` properties, access the
page you wish to modify, then go to `Site --> Properties`.

The `Name` tab allows you to:

- rename the page using the `Page Name` field;

- modify the `Page URL`. In this case, you can redirect the old URL to
  the new one if needed. To do so, enable `Redirect Old URL`, then
  select the `Type` of `redirection <website/URL-redirection>`:

  - `301 Moved permanently`: to redirect the page permanently;
  - `302 Moved temporarily`: to redirect the page temporarily.

  ![Redirect old URL](pages/page-redirection.png)

You can further adapt the page's properties in the `Publish` tab:

- `Show in Top Menu`: Disable if you don't want the page to appear in
  the menu;
- `Use as Homepage`: Enable if you want the page to be the homepage of
  your website;
- `Indexed`: Disable if you don't want the page to be shown in search
  engine results;
- `Published`: Enable to publish the page;
- `Publishing Date`: To publish the page at a specific moment, select
  the date, click the clock icon to set the time, then click the green
  check mark to validate your selection.
- `Visibility`: Select who can access the page:
  - `All`
  - `Signed In`
  - `Restricted Group`: Select the `user access group(s)
    </applications/general/users/access_rights>` in the
    `Authorized group` field.
  - `With Password`: Enter the password in the `Password` field.

> [!TIP]
> *Some* of these properties can also be modified from
> `Website --> Site --> Pages`.

#### Duplicating pages

To duplicate a page, access the page, then go to `Site --> Properties`
and click `Duplicate Page`. Enter a `Page Name`, then click `OK`. By
default, the new page is added after the duplicated page in the menu,
but you can remove it from the menu or change its position using the
`menu editor <pages/menus>`.

#### Deleting pages

To delete a page, proceed as follows:

1.  Access the page, then go to `Site --> Properties` and click `Delete
    Page`.
2.  A pop-up window appears on the screen with all links referring to
    the page you want to delete, organized by category. To ensure
    website visitors don't land on a 404 error page, you must update all
    the links on your website referring to the page. To do so, expand a
    category, then click on a link to open it in a new window.
    Alternatively, you can set up a `redirection
    <website/URL-redirection>` for the deleted page.
3.  Once you have updated the links (or set up a
    `redirection <website/URL-redirection>`), select the
    `I am sure about this` check box, then click `OK`.

### URL redirect mapping

URL redirect mapping consists in sending visitors and search engines to
a URL different from the one they initially requested. This technique is
used, for example, to prevent broken links when you
`delete a page <website/delete-page>`,
`modify its URL <website/page_properties>`, or migrate your site from
another platform to an Konvergo ERP `domain <configuration/domain_names>`. It
can also be used to improve `pages/seo`.

To access existing URL redirections and create new ones,
`activate the developer mode
</applications/general/developer_mode>` and go to
`Website --> Configuration -->
Redirects`.

> [!NOTE]
> - A redirect record is added automatically every time you
> `modify a page's URL
> <website/page_properties>` and enable `Redirect Old URL`. - You can
> set up redirections for
> `static and dynamic pages <website/page_type>`.

To create a new redirection, click the `New` button, then fill in the
fields:

- `Name`: Enter a name to identify the redirect.

- `Action`: Select the type of redirection:

  > - `404 Not found`: visitors are redirected to a 404 error page when
  >   they try to access an unpublished or deleted page.
  > - `301 Moved Permanently`: for permanent redirections of unpublished
  >   or deleted `static pages <website/page_type>`. The new URL is
  >   shown in search engine results, and the redirect is cached by
  >   browsers.
  > - `302 Moved Temporarily`: for short-term redirections, for example,
  >   if you are redesigning or updating a page. The new URL is neither
  >   cached by browsers nor shown in search engine results.
  > - `308 Redirect/Rewrite`: for permanent redirections of existing
  >   `dynamic pages
  >   <website/page_type>`. The URL is renamed; the new name is shown in
  >   search engine results and is cached by browsers. Use this redirect
  >   type to rename a dynamic page, for example, if you wish to rename
  >   <span class="title-ref">/shop</span> into
  >   <span class="title-ref">/market</span>.

- `URL from`: Enter the URL to be redirected (e.g.,
  <span class="title-ref">/about-the-company</span>) or search for the
  desired `dynamic page <website/page_type>` and select it from the
  list.

- `URL to`: For 301, 302, and 308 redirects, enter the URL to be
  redirected to. If you want to redirect to an external URL, include the
  protocol (e.g., <span class="title-ref">https://</span>).

- `Website`: Select a specific website.

- `Sequence`: To define the order in which redirections are performed,
  e.g., in the case of redirect chains (i.e., a series of redirects
  where one URL is redirected to another one, which is itself further
  redirected to another URL).

Toggle the `Activate` switch to deactivate the redirection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 404, 301, and 302 redirections are meant to migrate traffic from
> `unpublished <website/un-publish-page>` or
> `deleted <website/delete-page>` pages to *new* pages, while the 308
> redirect is used for *permanent* redirections of *existing* pages.
