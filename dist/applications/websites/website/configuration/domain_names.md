# Domain names

Domain names are text-based addresses identifying online locations, such
as websites. They provide a more memorable and recognizable way for
people to navigate the internet than numerical IP addresses.

**Konvergo ERP Online** and **Konvergo ERP.sh** databases use a **subdomain** of the
<span class="title-ref">odoo.com</span> **domain** by default (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">mycompany.odoo.com</span>).

However, you can use a custom domain name instead by
`registering a free domain name
<domain-name/register>` (only available for Konvergo ERP Online databases) or by
`configuring a
domain name you already own <domain-name/existing>`.

## Register a free domain name with Konvergo ERP

To register a one-year free domain name for your Konvergo ERP Online database,
sign in to your account and go to the [database
manager](https://www.odoo.com/my/databases). Click the gear icon (`⚙️`)
next to the database name and select `Domain Names`.

![Accessing a database's domain names configuration](domain_names/domain-names.png)

Search for the desired domain name and check its availability.

![Searching for an available domain name](domain_names/domain-search.png)

> [!TIP]
> Ensure the Website app is installed if the domain name registration
> option does not appear.

Select the desired domain name, fill in the `Domain Owner` form, and
click `Register`. The chosen domain name is directly linked to the
database.

![Filling in the domain owner information](domain_names/domain-owner.png)

Next, you should
`map your domain name to your Konvergo ERP website <domain-name/website-map>`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A verification email from
> <span class="title-ref">noreply@domainnameverification.net</span> will
> be sent to the email address provided in the `Domain Owner` form. It
> is essential to verify your email address to keep the domain active
> and receive the renewal quote before expiration.

The domain name registration is free for the first year. After this
period, Konvergo ERP will continue to manage the domain in partnership with
**Gandi.net**, the domain name registrar, and you will be charged
[Gandi.net's renewal rate](https://www.gandi.net/en/domain). Konvergo ERP sends
a renewal quotation every year to the email address mentioned in the
`Domain Owner` form several weeks before the expiration date of the
domain. The domain is renewed automatically when the quotation is
confirmed.

> [!NOTE]
> - The offer is only available for **Konvergo ERP Online** databases. - The
> offer is limited to **one** domain name per client. - The offer is
> limited to the registration of a **new** domain name. - The offer is
> available to *One App Free* plans. Ensure that your website contains
> enough original content for Konvergo ERP to verify that your request is
> legitimate and respects [Konvergo ERP's Acceptable Use
> Policy](https://www.odoo.com/acceptable-use). Given the high number of
> requests, it can take Konvergo ERP several days to review them.

### DNS records

To manage your free domain name `DNS (domain name system)` records, open
the [database manager](https://www.odoo.com/my/databases), click the
gear icon (`⚙️`) next to the database name, select `Domain Names`, and
click `DNS`.

- `A`: the A record holds the IP address of the domain. It is
  automatically created and **cannot** be edited or deleted.
- `CNAME`: CNAME records forward one domain or subdomain to another
  domain. One is automatically created to map the
  <span class="title-ref">www.</span> subdomain to the database. If the
  database is renamed, the CNAME record **must** also be renamed.
- `MX`: MX records instruct servers on where to deliver emails.
- `TXT`: TXT records can be used for different purposes (e.g., to verify
  domain name ownership).

Any modification to the DNS records can take up to **72 hours** to
propagate worldwide on all servers.

> [!NOTE]
> [Submit a support ticket](https://www.odoo.com/help) if you need
> assistance to manage your domain name.

### Mailbox

The one-year free domain name offer does **not** include a mailbox.
There are two options to link your domain name with a mailbox.

#### Use a subdomain

You can create a subdomain (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">subdomain.yourdomain.com</span>) to use as an
alias domain for the database. It allows users to create records in the
database from emails received on their
<span class="title-ref">email@subdomain.yourdomain.com</span> alias.

To do so, open the [database
manager](https://www.odoo.com/my/databases), click the gear icon (`⚙️`)
next to the database name, and go to `Domain Names --> DNS --> Add
DNS record --> CNAME`. Next, enter the desired subdomain in the `Name`
field (e.g., <span class="title-ref">subdomain</span>), the original
database domain with a period at the end (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">mycompany.odoo.com.</span>) in the `Content`
field, and click `Add record`.

Then, add the alias domain as your *own domain* by clicking
`Use my own domain`, entering the alias domain (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">subdomain.yourdomain.com</span>), clicking
`Verify`, and then `I confirm, it's done`.

Finally, go to your database and open the `Settings`. Enable
`Custom Email
Servers`, enter the `Alias Domain` (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">subdomain.yourdomain.com</span>) and click
`Save`.

#### Use an external email provider

To use an external email provider, you should configure an MX record. To
do so, open the [database manager](https://www.odoo.com/my/databases),
click the gear icon (`⚙️`) next to the database name, click
`Domain Names --> DNS --> Add DNS record --> MX`. The values you should
enter for the `Name`, `Content`, and `Priority` fields depend on the
external email provider.

</div>

## Configure an existing domain name

If you already have a domain name, you can use it for your Konvergo ERP website.

> [!WARNING]
> It is strongly recommended to follow **in order** these three steps to
> avoid any `SSL

>
> 1.  `Add a CNAME record <domain-name/cname>`
> 2.  `Map your domain name to your Konvergo ERP database <domain-name/db-map>`
> 3.  `Map your domain name to your Konvergo ERP website <domain-name/website-map>`

### Add a CNAME record

Adding a CNAME record to forward your domain name to the address of your
Konvergo ERP database is required.

<div class="tabs">

<div class="group-tab">

Konvergo ERP Online

The CNAME record's target address should be your database's address as
defined at its creation (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">mycompany.odoo.com</span>).

</div>

<div class="group-tab">

Konvergo ERP.sh

The CNAME record's target address should be the project's main address,
which can be found on Konvergo ERP.sh by going to `Settings --> Project Name`,
or a specific branch (production, staging or development) by going to
`Branches --> select the
branch --> Settings --> Custom domains`, and clicking
`How to set up my domain?`. A message indicates which address your CNAME
record should target.

</div>

</div>

The specific instructions depend on your DNS hosting service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Konvergo ERP only supports subdomains. To use your naked domain name
> `(a domain name without any

> (<span class="title-ref">yourdomain.com</span>), create a redirection
> 301 to redirect visitors to
> <span class="title-ref">www.yourdomain.com</span>.

<div class="example">

You own the domain name <span class="title-ref">yourdomain.com</span>,
and your Konvergo ERP Online database's address is
<span class="title-ref">mycompany.odoo.com</span>. You want to access
your Konvergo ERP database primarily with the domain
<span class="title-ref">www.yourdomain.com</span> and also with the
naked domain <span class="title-ref">yourdomain.com</span>.

To do so, create a CNAME record for the
<span class="title-ref">www</span> subdomain, with
<span class="title-ref">mycompany.odoo.com</span> as the target. Next,
create a redirect (301 permanent or visible redirect) to redirect
visitors from <span class="title-ref">yourdomain.com</span> to
<span class="title-ref">wwww.yourdomain.com</span>.

#### SSL encryption (HTTPS protocol)

**SSL encryption** allows visitors to navigate a website through a
secure connection, which appears as the *https://* protocol at the
beginning of a web address rather than the non-secure *http://*
protocol.

Konvergo ERP generates a separate SSL certificate for each domain
`mapped to a database
<domain-name/db-map>` using [Let's Encrypt's certificate authority and
ACME protocol](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/).

> [!NOTE]
> - Certificate generation may take up to 24 hours. - Several attempts
> to validate your certificate are made for five days after you map your
> domain name to your database. - If you use another service, you can
> keep using it or change to Konvergo ERP's.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> No SSL certificate is generated for naked domains
> `(domain names without any subdomains
> or prefixes)`.

#### Web base URL of a database

> [!NOTE]
> If the Website app is installed on your database, skip this section
> and continue from the
> `Map a domain name to a website <domain-name/website-map>` section.

The *web base URL* or root URL of a database affects your main website
address and all the links sent to your customers (e.g., quotations,
portal links, etc.).

To make your custom domain name the *web base URL* of your database,
access your database using your custom domain name and log in as an
administrator `(a user part of the Settings access right
group under Administration)`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you access your database with the original Konvergo ERP address (e.g.,
> <span class="title-ref">mycompany.odoo.com</span>), the *web base URL*
> of your database will be updated accordingly. To prevent the automatic
> update of the *web base URL* when an administrator logs in to the
> database, activate the `developer mode
> <developer-mode>`, go to
> `Settings --> Technical --> System Parameters --> New`, and enter
> <span class="title-ref">web.base.url.freeze</span> as the `Key` and
> <span class="title-ref">True</span> as the `Value`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also set the web base URL manually. To do so, activate the
> `developer mode
> <developer-mode>`, go to
> `Settings --> Technical --> System Parameters`, and search for the
> <span class="title-ref">web.base.url</span> key (create it if
> necessary) and enter the full address of your website as the value
> (e.g., <span class="title-ref">https://www.yourdomain.com</span>). The
> URL must include the protocol <span class="title-ref">https://</span>
> (or <span class="title-ref">http://</span>) and *not* end with a slash
> (<span class="title-ref">/</span>).

### Map a domain name to an Konvergo ERP website

Mapping your domain name to your website is different than mapping it to
your database:

- It defines your domain name as the main one for your website, helping
  search engines to index your website correctly.
- It defines your domain name as the base URL for your database,
  including portal links sent by email to your customers.
- If you have multiple websites, it maps your domain name to the
  appropriate website.

Go to `Website --> Configuration --> Settings`. If you have multiple
websites, select the one you want to configure. In the `Domain` field,
enter the address of your website (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">https://www.yourdomain.com</span>) and `Save`.

> [!WARNING]
> Mapping your domain name to your Konvergo ERP website prevents Google Search
> from indexing your original database address (e.g.,
> <span class="title-ref">mycompany.odoo.com</span>).
>
> If both addresses are already indexed, it may take some time before
> the indexation of the second address is removed from Google Search.
> You can use the [Google Search
> Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome) to fix the
> issue.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have multiple websites and companies on your database, make
> sure to select the right `Company` under
> `Website --> Configuration --> Settings`. Doing so indicates Konvergo ERP
> which URL to use as the `base URL <domain-name/web-base-url>`
> according to the company in use.
