# Live Chat

Odoo *Live Chat* allows users to communicate with website visitors in
real time. With *Live Chat*, leads can be qualified for their sales
potential, support questions can be answered quickly, and issues can be
directed to the appropriate team for further investigation (or follow
up). *Live Chat* also provides the opportunity for instant feedback from
customers.

## Enable Live Chat

In order to enable *Live Chat*, the *Live Chat* application needs to be
installed. This can be done in one of two ways.

- Go to `Apps --> Live Chat` and click `Install`.
- In the `Website` application, go to `Configuration --> Settings`,
  scroll to the `Email & Marketing` section, check the box next to
  `Livechat`, and click `Save`.

After the `Live Chat` application is installed, a live chat `Channel`
will be created by default and automatically selected in the drop-down.

## Create a new live chat channel

To create a new live chat *Channel*, go to
`Main Odoo Dashboard --> Live Chat app -->
New`. This will open a blank channel detail form. Enter the name of the
new channel in the `Channel Name` field.

<img src="livechat/open-channel.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of a live chat channel form for Odoo Live Chat." />

To configure the remaining tabs on the channel detail form (`Operators`,
`Options`, `Channel Rules`, and `Widgets`), follow the steps below.

### Operators

*Operators* are the users who will respond to live chat requests from
customers. When a user is added as an operator in a live chat channel,
they will be able to receive chats from website visitors wherever they
are in the database. Chat windows will open in the bottom right corner
of the screen.

<img src="livechat/pop-up.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of a live chat pop up window in an Odoo database." />

The user who originally created the live chat channel will be added as
an operator by default.

To add additional users, navigate back to the
`Website Live Chat Channels` dashboard via the breadcrumbs and click on
the appropriate `Live Chat Channel`. Then, on the channel detail form,
under the `Operators` tab, click `ADD` to reveal an `Add:
Operators` pop-up window.

In the pop-up window, search for the desired user(s). Then, click the
checkbox next to the user(s) to be added, and click `SELECT`.

New operators can be created and added to the list directly from this
pop-up, as well, by clicking `New`, and filling out the
`Create Operators` pop-up form. When the form is complete, click
`SAVE & CLOSE` (or `SAVE & NEW` for multiple record creations).

> [!NOTE]
> Current operators can be edited (or removed) by clicking on their
> respective boxes in the `Operators` tab, which reveals a separate
> `Open: Operators` pop-up. In that pop-up, adjust any information as
> needed, and click `Save`, or click `Remove` to remove that operator
> from the channel.

### Options

The `Options` tab on the live chat channel details form contains the
visual and text settings for the live chat window.

#### Livechat button

The *Livechat Button* is the icon that appears in the bottom corner of
the website.

<img src="livechat/chat-button.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of an Odoo website emphasizing the livechat button." />

Change the text in the `Text of the Button` field to update the greeting
displayed in the text bubble when the live chat button appears on the
website.

Change the `Livechat Button Color` by clicking a color bubble to open
the color selection window. Click the `ðŸ”„ (refresh)` icon to the right
of the color bubbles to reset the colors to the default selection.

> [!TIP]
> Color selection, for the button or header, can be made manually using
> a slider or through RGB, HSL, or HEX color code entries from the
> pop-up color selection window that appears when either of the color
> bubbles are clicked. Different options will be available, depending on
> your operating system.

#### Livechat window

The *Livechat Window* is the space where the live chat conversation with
website visitors takes place.

Edit the `Welcome Message` to change the message a visitor sees when
they open a new chat session. This message will appear as though it is
sent by a live chat operator, and acts as both a greeting and an
invitation to continue the conversation.

Edit the `Chat Input Placeholder` to alter the text that appears in the
box where visitors will type their replies.

The *Channel Header* is the colored bar at the top of the chat window.
The `Channel Header
Color` can be changed following the same steps as the *Livechat Button
Color* above.

### Channel rules

The `Channel Rules` tab on the live chat channel details form determines
when the *Live Chat Window* opens on the website, by configuring when a
`URL Regex` action is triggered (e.g., a page visit).

To create a new channel rule, click `Add a line`. This opens the
`Open: Rules` pop-up.

<img src="livechat/create-rules.png" class="align-center"

#### Create new rules

Fill out the fields on the `Open: Rules` pop-up as instructed below,
then click `Save`.

<div class="tabs">

<div class="tab">

Live Chat Button

The *Livechat Button* is the icon that appears in the bottom corner of
the website. Select from one of the following display options:

- `Show` displays the chat button on the page(s).
- `Show with notification` displays the chat button, as well as a
  floating text bubble next to the button.
- `Open automatically` displays the button and automatically opens the
  chat window after a specified amount of time (designated in the
  `Open automatically timer` field).
- `Hide` hides the chat button on the page(s).

</div>

<div class="tab">

Chatbot

If a *Chatbot* will be included on this channel, select it from the
dropdown. If the chatbot will only be active when no operators are
active, check the box labeled `Enabled
only if no operator`.

</div>

<div class="tab">

URL Regex

In the `URL Regex` field, input the relative URL of the page where the
chat button should appear.

</div>

<div class="tab">

Open automatically timer

This field designates the amount of time (in seconds) a page will be
open before the chat window will open. If the `Livechat Button` for this
rule is not set to `Open automatically`, this field will be ignored.

</div>

<div class="tab">

Country

If this channel should only be available to site visitors in specific
countries, add them to the `Country` field. If this field is left blank,
the channel will be available to all site visitors, regardless of
location.

</div>

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> In order to track the geographical location of visitors, `GeoIP` must
> be installed on the database. While this feature is installed by
> default on *Odoo Online*, *On-Premise* databases will require
> additional `setup steps </administration/on_premise/geo_ip>`.

### Widget

The `Widget` tab on the live chat channel details form provides the
shortcode for an embeddable website widget. This code can be added to a
website to provide access to a live chat window.

The live chat widget can be added to websites created through Odoo by
navigating to the `Website --> Configuration --> Settings`. Then scroll
to the `Livechat` section, and select the channel to add to the site.
Click `Save` to apply.

To add the widget to a website created on a third-party platform, click
the first `COPY` button on the `Widget` tab and paste the code into the
<span class="title-ref">\<head\></span> tag on the site.

Likewise, to send a live chat session to a customer, click the second
`COPY` button on the `Widget` tab. This link can be sent directly to a
customer, and once they click the link, it will open a new chat.

## Participate in a conversation

As explained above, *operators* are the users who will respond to live
chat requests from customers. The information below outlines the
necessary steps for operators participating in live chat conversations
on an Odoo database.

### Set an online chat name

Before participating in a live chat, operators should update their
*Online Chat Name*. This is the name that will be displayed to site
visitors in the live chat conversation.

To update the `Online Chat Name`, click on the user name in the
upper-right corner of any page in the database. Select `My Profile` to
open the Profile page. On the right side of the `Preferences` tab,
locate the `Online Chat Name` field and enter the preferred name.

<img src="livechat/my-profile.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the My Profile option in Odoo." />

If a users `Online Chat Name` is not set, the name displayed will
default to the `User Name`.

<div class="example">

A user has their full name as their `User Name`, but they do not want to
include their last name in a live chat conversation. They would then set
their `Online Chat Name` to include only their first name.

alt="View of user profile in Odoo, emphasizing the Online Chat name field." />

</div>

### Join or leave a channel

To join a live chat channel, go to the `Live Chat` app and click the
`JOIN` button on the kanban card for the appropriate channel.

Any channel where the user is currently active will show a `LEAVE`
button. Click this button to disconnect from the channel.

<img src="livechat/leave-channel.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of a channel form and the option to join a channel for Odoo Live Chat." />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Operators* that do not show any activity in Odoo for more than thirty
> minutes will be considered disconnected, and subsequently removed from
> the channel.

### Manage live chat requests

When an operator is active in a channel, chat windows will open in the
bottom right corner of the screen, no matter where they are in the
database. They can participate in conversations without leaving their
current location.

> [!TIP]
> Conversations can also be accessed by clicking the `Conversations`
> icon in the menu bar.
>
> <img src="livechat/menu-bar.png" class="align-center"
> alt="View of the menu bar in Odoo emphasizing the conversations icon." />

Live chat conversations can also be viewed by navigating to
`Dashboard --> Discuss`. New conversations will appear in bold under the
`LIVECHAT` heading along the left panel.

<img src="livechat/managing-chat-responses.png" class="align-center"
alt="View of the discuss application with a message sent through live chat in Odoo." />

Click on a conversation in the left panel to select it. This will open
the conversation. From this view, an operator can participate in the
chat the same as they would in the normal chat window.
