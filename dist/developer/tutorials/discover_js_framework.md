This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the basics of the Konvergo ERP
Javascript framework. Whether you are new to the framework or have some
prior experience, this tutorial will provide you with a solid foundation
for using the Konvergo ERP JavaScript framework in your projects.

This tutorial is divided into two parts. The first part covers the
basics of Owl components, which are a key part of the Konvergo ERP JS framework.
Owl components are reusable UI components that can be used to build
complex web interfaces quickly and efficiently. We will explore how to
create and use Owl components in Konvergo ERP.

The second part of the tutorial focuses on creating a dashboard using
various features of Konvergo ERP. Dashboards are an essential part of any web
application, and provide a nice starting point to use and interact with
the Konvergo ERP codebase.

This tutorial assumes that you have some basic knowledge of development
with Konvergo ERP in general (models, controllers, QWeb, ...). If you are new to
Konvergo ERP, we recommend that you start with the
`Getting started </developer/tutorials/getting_started>` tutorial before
proceeding with this one.
