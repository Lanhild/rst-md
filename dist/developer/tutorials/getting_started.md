Welcome to the Getting Started Konvergo ERP tutorial! If you reached this page
that means you are interested in the development of your own Konvergo ERP
module. It might also mean that you recently joined the Konvergo ERP company for
a rather technical position. In any case, your journey to the technical
side of Konvergo ERP starts here.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to get an insight of the most
important parts of the Konvergo ERP development framework while developing your
own Konvergo ERP module to manage real estate assets. The chapters should be
followed in their given order since they cover the development of a new
Konvergo ERP application from scratch in an incremental way. In other words,
each chapter depends on the previous one.
