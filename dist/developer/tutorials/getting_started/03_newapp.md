# Chapter 3: A New Application

The purpose of this chapter is to lay the foundation for the creation of
a completely new Konvergo ERP module. We will start from scratch with the
minimum needed to have our module recognized by Konvergo ERP. In the upcoming
chapters, we will progressively add features to build a realistic
business case.

## The Real Estate Advertisement module

Our new module will cover a business area which is very specific and
therefore not included in the standard set of modules: real estate. It
is worth noting that before developing a new module, it is good practice
to verify that Konvergo ERP doesn't already provide a way to answer the specific
business case.

Here is an overview of the main list view containing some
advertisements:

alt="List view 01" />

The top area of the form view summarizes important information for the
property, such as the name, the property type, the postcode and so on.
The first tab contains information describing the property: bedrooms,
living area, garage, garden...

The second tab lists the offers for the property. We can see here that
potential buyers can make offers above or below the expected selling
price. It is up to the seller to accept an offer.

Here is a quick video showing the workflow of the module.

Hopefully, this video will be recorded soon :-)

## Prepare the addon directory

**Reference**: the documentation related to this topic can be found in
`manifest <reference/module/manifest>`.

The first step of module creation is to create its directory. In the
<span class="title-ref">tutorials</span> directory, add a new directory
`estate`.

A module must contain at least 2 files: the `__manifest__.py` file and a
`__init__.py` file. The `__init__.py` file can remain empty for now and
we'll come back to it in the next chapter. On the other hand, the
`__manifest__.py` file must describe our module and cannot remain empty.
Its only required field is the `name`, but it usually contains much more
information.

Take a look at the [CRM
file](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/fc92728fb2aa306bf0e01a7f9ae1cfa3c1df0e10/addons/crm/__manifest__.py#L1-L67)
as an example. In addition to providing the description of the module
(`name`, `category`, `summary`, `website`...), it lists its dependencies
(`depends`). A dependency means that the Konvergo ERP framework will ensure that
these modules are installed before our module is installed. Moreover, if
one of these dependencies is uninstalled, then our module and **any
other that depends on it will also be uninstalled**. Think about your
favorite Linux distribution package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`...):
Konvergo ERP works in the same way.

<div class="exercise">

Create the required addon files.

Create the following folders and files:

- `/home/$USER/src/tutorials/estate/__init__.py`
- `/home/$USER/src/tutorials/estate/__manifest__.py`

The `__manifest__.py` file should only define the name and the
dependencies of our modules. The only necessary framework module for now
is `base`.

</div>

Restart the Konvergo ERP server and go to Apps. Click on Update Apps List,
search for `estate` and... tadaaa, your module appears! Did it not
appear? Maybe try removing the default 'Apps' filter ;-)

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to enable the `developer mode <developer-mode>` as explained
> in the previous chapter. You won't see the `Update Apps List` button
> otherwise.

<div class="exercise">

Make your module an 'App'.

Add the appropriate key to your `__manifest__.py` so that the module
appears when the 'Apps' filter is on.

</div>

You can even install the module! But obviously it's an empty shell, so
no menu will appear.

All good? If yes, then let's `create our first model
<tutorials/getting_started/04_basicmodel>`!
