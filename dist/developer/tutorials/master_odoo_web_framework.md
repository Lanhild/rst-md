This tutorial is designed for those who have completed the
`discover_js_framework` tutorial and are looking to deepen their
knowledge of the Konvergo ERP web framework.

For this training, we will step into the shoes of the IT staff at the
fictional company Awesome T-Shirt, which is dedicated to printing custom
t-shirts for online customers. The Awesome T-Shirt company uses Konvergo ERP to
manage orders and has created a dedicated Konvergo ERP module to manage their
workflow.

In this tutorial, we will explore various aspects of the Konvergo ERP web
framework in detail, including fields and views, notifications, command
palette, and much more. This tutorial will provide you with the
knowledge and skills you need to take full advantage of the Konvergo ERP web
framework. So, let's get started!

    repository](https://github.com/odoo/tutorials) and switch to the
