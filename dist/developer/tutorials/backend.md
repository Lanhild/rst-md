## Start/Stop the Konvergo ERP server

Konvergo ERP uses a client/server architecture in which clients are web browsers
accessing the Konvergo ERP server via RPC.

Business logic and extension is generally performed on the server side,
although supporting client features (e.g. new data representation such
as interactive maps) can be added to the client.

In order to start the server, simply invoke the command `odoo-bin
<reference/cmdline>` in the shell, adding the full path to the file if
necessary:

``` bash
odoo-bin
```

The server is stopped by hitting `Ctrl-C` twice from the terminal, or by
killing the corresponding OS process.

## Build an Konvergo ERP module

Both server and client extensions are packaged as *modules* which are
optionally loaded in a *database*.

Konvergo ERP modules can either add brand new business logic to an Konvergo ERP system,
or alter and extend existing business logic: a module can be created to
add your country's accounting rules to Konvergo ERP's generic accounting
support, while the next module adds support for real-time visualisation
of a bus fleet.

Everything in Konvergo ERP thus starts and ends with modules.

### Composition of a module

An Konvergo ERP module can contain a number of elements:

Business objects  
Declared as Python classes, these resources are automatically persisted
by Konvergo ERP based on their configuration

`Object views <reference/views>`  
Definition of business objects UI display

`Data files <reference/data>`  
XML or CSV files declaring the model metadata :

- `views <reference/views>` or `reports <reference/reports>`,
- configuration data (modules parametrization,
  `security rules <reference/security>`),
- demonstration data
- and more

`Web controllers <reference/controllers>`  
Handle requests from web browsers

Static web data  
Images, CSS or javascript files used by the web interface or website

### Module structure

Each module is a directory within a *module directory*. Module
directories are specified by using the
`--addons-path <odoo-bin --addons-path>` option.

> [!TIP]
> most command-line options can also be set using `a configuration file
> <reference/cmdline/config>`

An Konvergo ERP module is declared by its
`manifest <reference/module/manifest>`.

A module is also a [Python
package](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages) with a
`__init__.py` file, containing import instructions for various Python
files in the module.

For instance, if the module has a single `mymodule.py` file
`__init__.py` might contain:

    from . import mymodule

Konvergo ERP provides a mechanism to help set up a new module, `odoo-bin
<reference/cmdline/server>` has a subcommand `scaffold
<reference/cmdline/scaffold>` to create an empty module:

``` console
$ odoo-bin scaffold <module name> <where to put it>
```

The command creates a subdirectory for your module, and automatically
creates a bunch of standard files for a module. Most of them simply
contain commented code or XML. The usage of most of those files will be
explained along this tutorial.

### Object-Relational Mapping

A key component of Konvergo ERP is the `ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)` layer.
This layer avoids having to write most `SQL (Structured Query Language)`
by hand and provides extensibility and security services[^1].

Business objects are declared as Python classes extending
`~odoo.models.Model` which integrates them into the automated
persistence system.

Models can be configured by setting a number of attributes at their
definition. The most important attribute is `~odoo.models.Model._name`
which is required and defines the name for the model in the Konvergo ERP system.
Here is a minimally complete definition of a model:

    from odoo import models
    class MinimalModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'test.model'

### Model fields

Fields are used to define what the model can store and where. Fields are
defined as attributes on the model class:

    from odoo import models, fields

    class LessMinimalModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'test.model2'

        name = fields.Char()

#### Common Attributes

Much like the model itself, its fields can be configured, by passing
configuration attributes as parameters:

    name = fields.Char(required=True)

Some attributes are available on all fields, here are the most common
ones:

`~odoo.fields.Field.string` (`unicode`, default: field's name)  
The label of the field in UI (visible by users).

`~odoo.fields.Field.required` (`bool`, default: `False`)  
If `True`, the field can not be empty, it must either have a default
value or always be given a value when creating a record.

`~odoo.fields.Field.help` (`unicode`, default: `''`)  
Long-form, provides a help tooltip to users in the UI.

`~odoo.fields.Field.index` (`bool`, default: `False`)  
Requests that Konvergo ERP create a [database
index](https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/preface) on the column.

#### Simple fields

There are two broad categories of fields: "simple" fields which are
atomic values stored directly in the model's table and "relational"
fields linking records (of the same model or of different models).

Example of simple fields are `~odoo.fields.Boolean`,
`~odoo.fields.Date`, `~odoo.fields.Char`.

#### Reserved fields

Konvergo ERP creates a few fields in all models[^2]. These fields are managed by
the system and shouldn't be written to. They can be read if useful or
necessary:

`~odoo.fields.Model.id` (`~odoo.fields.Id`)  
The unique identifier for a record in its model.

`~odoo.fields.Model.create_date` (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`)  
Creation date of the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.create_uid` (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`)  
User who created the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.write_date` (`~odoo.fields.Datetime`)  
Last modification date of the record.

`~odoo.fields.Model.write_uid` (`~odoo.fields.Many2one`)  
user who last modified the record.

#### Special fields

By default, Konvergo ERP also requires a `name` field on all models for various
display and search behaviors. The field used for these purposes can be
overridden by setting `~odoo.models.Model._rec_name`.

<div class="exercise">

Define a model

Define a new data model *Course* in the *openacademy* module. A course
has a title and a description. Courses must have a title.

</div>

### Data files

Konvergo ERP is a highly data driven system. Although behavior is customized
using [Python](https://python.org) code part of a module's value is in
the data it sets up when loaded.

> [!TIP]
> some modules exist solely to add data into Konvergo ERP

Module data is declared via `data files <reference/data>`, XML files
with `<record>` elements. Each `<record>` element creates or updates a
database record.

``` xml
<odoo>

        <record model="{model name}" id="{record identifier}">
            <field name="{a field name}">{a value}</field>
        </record>

</odoo>
```

- `model` is the name of the Konvergo ERP model for the record.
- `id` is an `external identifier`, it allows referring to the record
  (without having to know its in-database identifier).
- `<field>` elements have a `name` which is the name of the field in the
  model (e.g. `description`). Their body is the field's value.

Data files have to be declared in the manifest file to be loaded, they
can be declared in the `'data'` list (always loaded) or in the `'demo'`
list (only loaded in demonstration mode).

<div class="exercise">

Define demonstration data

Create demonstration data filling the *Courses* model with a few
demonstration courses.

</div>

> [!TIP]
> The content of the data files is only loaded when a module is
> installed or updated.
>
> After making some changes, do not forget to use
> `odoo-bin -u openacademy
> <reference/cmdline>` to save the changes to your database.

### Actions and Menus

Actions and menus are regular records in database, usually declared
through data files. Actions can be triggered in three ways:

1.  by clicking on menu items (linked to specific actions)
2.  by clicking on buttons in views (if these are connected to actions)
3.  as contextual actions on object

Because menus are somewhat complex to declare there is a `<menuitem>`
shortcut to declare an `ir.ui.menu` and connect it to the corresponding
action more easily.

``` xml
<record model="ir.actions.act_window" id="action_list_ideas">
    <field name="name">Ideas</field>
    <field name="res_model">idea.idea</field>
    <field name="view_mode">tree,form</field>
</record>
<menuitem id="menu_ideas" parent="menu_root" name="Ideas" sequence="10"
          action="action_list_ideas"/>
```

<div class="danger aphorism">

<div class="title">

Danger

</div>

The action must be declared before its corresponding menu in the XML
file.

Data files are executed sequentially, the action's `id` must be present
in the database before the menu can be created.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Define new menu entries

Define new menu entries to access courses under the OpenAcademy menu
entry. A user should be able to:

- display a list of all the courses
- create/modify courses

</div>

## Basic views

Views define the way the records of a model are displayed. Each type of
view represents a mode of visualization (a list of records, a graph of
their aggregation, …). Views can either be requested generically via
their type (e.g. *a list of partners*) or specifically via their id. For
generic requests, the view with the correct type and the lowest priority
will be used (so the lowest-priority view of each type is the default
view for that type).

`View inheritance <reference/views/inheritance>` allows altering views
declared elsewhere (adding or removing content).

### Generic view declaration

A view is declared as a record of the model `ir.ui.view`. The view type
is implied by the root element of the `arch` field:

``` xml
<record model="ir.ui.view" id="view_id">
    <field name="name">view.name</field>
    <field name="model">object_name</field>
    <field name="priority" eval="16"/>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <!-- view content: <form>, <tree>, <graph>, ... -->
    </field>
</record>
```

<div class="danger aphorism">

<div class="title">

Danger

</div>

The view's content is XML.

The `arch` field must thus be declared as `type="xml"` to be parsed
correctly.

</div>

### Tree views

Tree views, also called list views, display records in a tabular form.

Their root element is `<tree>`. The simplest form of the tree view
simply lists all the fields to display in the table (each field as a
column):

``` xml
<tree string="Idea list">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
</tree>
```

### Form views

Forms are used to create and edit single records.

Their root element is `<form>`. They are composed of high-level
structure elements (groups, notebooks) and interactive elements (buttons
and fields):

``` xml
<form string="Idea form">
    <group colspan="4">
        <group colspan="2" col="2">
            <separator string="General stuff" colspan="2"/>
            <field name="name"/>
            <field name="inventor_id"/>
        </group>

        <group colspan="2" col="2">
            <separator string="Dates" colspan="2"/>
            <field name="active"/>
            <field name="invent_date" readonly="1"/>
        </group>

        <notebook colspan="4">
            <page string="Description">
                <field name="description" nolabel="1"/>
            </page>
        </notebook>

        <field name="state"/>
    </group>
</form>
```

<div class="exercise">

Customise form view using XML

Create your own form view for the Course object. Data displayed should
be: the name and the description of the course.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Notebooks

In the Course form view, put the description field under a tab, such
that it will be easier to add other tabs later, containing additional
information.

</div>

Form views can also use plain HTML for more flexible layouts:

``` xml
<form string="Idea Form">
    <header>
        <button string="Confirm" type="object" name="action_confirm"
                states="draft" class="oe_highlight" />
        <button string="Mark as done" type="object" name="action_done"
                states="confirmed" class="oe_highlight"/>
        <button string="Reset to draft" type="object" name="action_draft"
                states="confirmed,done" />
        <field name="state" widget="statusbar"/>
    </header>
    <sheet>
        <div class="oe_title">
            <label for="name" class="oe_edit_only" string="Idea Name" />
            <h1><field name="name" /></h1>
        </div>
        <separator string="General" colspan="2" />
        <group colspan="2" col="2">
            <field name="description" placeholder="Idea description..." />
        </group>
    </sheet>
</form>
```

### Search views

Search views customize the search field associated with the list view
(and other aggregated views). Their root element is `<search>` and
they're composed of fields defining which fields can be searched on:

``` xml
<search>
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
</search>
```

If no search view exists for the model, Konvergo ERP generates one which only
allows searching on the `name` field.

<div class="exercise">

Search courses

Allow searching for courses based on their title or their description.

</div>

## Relations between models

A record from a model may be related to a record from another model. For
instance, a sale order record is related to a client record that
contains the client data; it is also related to its sale order line
records.

<div class="exercise">

Create a session model

For the module Open Academy, we consider a model for *sessions*: a
session is an occurrence of a course taught at a given time for a given
audience.

Create a model for *sessions*. A session has a name, a start date, a
duration and a number of seats. Add an action and a menu item to display
them. Make the new model visible via a menu item.

</div>

### Relational fields

Relational fields link records, either of the same model (hierarchies)
or between different models.

Relational field types are:

`Many2one(other_model, ondelete='set null') <odoo.fields.Many2one>`  
A simple link to an other object:

    print(foo.other_id.name)

<div class="seealso">

[foreign
keys](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/tutorial-fk.html)

</div>

`One2many(other_model, related_field) <odoo.fields.One2many>`  
A virtual relationship, inverse of a `~odoo.fields.Many2one`. A
`~odoo.fields.One2many` behaves as a container of records, accessing it
results in a (possibly empty) set of records:

    for other in foo.other_ids:
        print(other.name)

<div class="danger">

<div class="title">

Danger

</div>

Because a `~odoo.fields.One2many` is a virtual relationship, there
*must* be a `~odoo.fields.Many2one` field in the `{other_model}`, and
its name *must* be `{related_field}`

</div>

`Many2many(other_model) <odoo.fields.Many2many>`  
Bidirectional multiple relationship, any record on one side can be
related to any number of records on the other side. Behaves as a
container of records, accessing it also results in a possibly empty set
of records:

    for other in foo.other_ids:
        print(other.name)

<div class="exercise">

Many2one relations

Using a many2one, modify the *Course* and *Session* models to reflect
their relation with other models:

- A course has a *responsible* user; the value of that field is a record
  of the built-in model `res.users`.
- A session has an *instructor*; the value of that field is a record of
  the built-in model `res.partner`.
- A session is related to a *course*; the value of that field is a
  record of the model `openacademy.course` and is required.
- Adapt the views.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Inverse one2many relations

Using the inverse relational field one2many, modify the models to
reflect the relation between courses and sessions.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Multiple many2many relations

Using the relational field many2many, modify the *Session* model to
relate every session to a set of *attendees*. Attendees will be
represented by partner records, so we will relate to the built-in model
`res.partner`. Adapt the views accordingly.

</div>

## Inheritance

### Model inheritance

Konvergo ERP provides two *inheritance* mechanisms to extend an existing model
in a modular way.

The first inheritance mechanism allows a module to modify the behavior
of a model defined in another module:

- add fields to a model,
- override the definition of fields on a model,
- add constraints to a model,
- add methods to a model,
- override existing methods on a model.

The second inheritance mechanism (delegation) allows to link every
record of a model to a record in a parent model, and provides
transparent access to the fields of the parent record.

<img src="../reference/backend/orm/inheritance_methods.png"
class="align-center" alt="image" />

<div class="seealso">

\* `~odoo.models.Model._inherit` \* `~odoo.models.Model._inherits`

</div>

### View inheritance

Instead of modifying existing views in place (by overwriting them), Konvergo ERP
provides view inheritance where children "extension" views are applied
on top of root views, and can add or remove content from their parent.

An extension view references its parent using the `inherit_id` field,
and instead of a single view its `arch` field is composed of any number
of `xpath` elements selecting and altering the content of their parent
view:

``` xml
<!-- improved idea categories list -->
<record id="idea_category_list2" model="ir.ui.view">
    <field name="name">id.category.list2</field>
    <field name="model">idea.category</field>
    <field name="inherit_id" ref="id_category_list"/>
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <!-- find field description and add the field
             idea_ids after it -->
        <xpath expr="//field[@name='description']" position="after">
          <field name="idea_ids" string="Number of ideas"/>
        </xpath>
    </field>
</record>
```

`expr`  
An [XPath](https://w3.org/TR/xpath) expression selecting a single
element in the parent view. Raises an error if it matches no element or
more than one

`position`  
Operation to apply to the matched element:

`inside`  
appends `xpath`'s body at the end of the matched element

`replace`  
replaces the matched element with the `xpath`'s body, replacing any `$0`
node occurrence in the new body with the original element

`before`  
inserts the `xpath`'s body as a sibling before the matched element

`after`  
inserts the `xpaths`'s body as a sibling after the matched element

`attributes`  
alters the attributes of the matched element using special `attribute`
elements in the `xpath`'s body

> [!TIP]
> When matching a single element, the `position` attribute can be set
> directly on the element to be found. Both inheritances below will give
> the same result.
>
> ``` xml
> <xpath expr="//field[@name='description']" position="after">
>     <field name="idea_ids" />
> </xpath>
>
> <field name="description" position="after">
>     <field name="idea_ids" />
> </field>
> ```

<div class="exercise">

Alter existing content

- Using model inheritance, modify the existing *Partner* model to add an
  `instructor` boolean field, and a many2many field that corresponds to
  the session-partner relation
- Using view inheritance, display this fields in the partner form view

</div>

#### Domains

In Konvergo ERP, `reference/orm/domains` are values that encode conditions on
records. A domain is a list of criteria used to select a subset of a
model's records. Each criteria is a triple with a field name, an
operator and a value.

For instance, when used on the *Product* model the following domain
selects all *services* with a unit price over *1000*:

    [('product_type', '=', 'service'), ('unit_price', '>', 1000)]

By default criteria are combined with an implicit AND. The logical
operators `&` (AND), `|` (OR) and `!` (NOT) can be used to explicitly
combine criteria. They are used in prefix position (the operator is
inserted before its arguments rather than between). For instance to
select products "which are services *OR* have a unit price which is
*NOT* between 1000 and 2000":

    ['|',
        ('product_type', '=', 'service'),
        '!', '&',
            ('unit_price', '>=', 1000),
            ('unit_price', '<', 2000)]

A `domain` parameter can be added to relational fields to limit valid
records for the relation when trying to select records in the client
interface.

<div class="exercise">

Domains on relational fields

When selecting the instructor for a *Session*, only instructors
(partners with `instructor` set to `True`) should be visible.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

More complex domains

Create new partner categories *Teacher / Level 1* and *Teacher / Level
2*. The instructor for a session can be either an instructor or a
teacher (of any level).

</div>

## Computed fields and default values

So far fields have been stored directly in and retrieved directly from
the database. Fields can also be *computed*. In that case, the field's
value is not retrieved from the database but computed on-the-fly by
calling a method of the model.

To create a computed field, create a field and set its attribute
`~odoo.fields.Field.compute` to the name of a method. The computation
method should simply set the value of the field to compute on every
record in `self`.

<div class="danger aphorism">

<div class="title">

Danger

</div>

`self` is a collection

The object `self` is a *recordset*, i.e., an ordered collection of
records. It supports the standard Python operations on collections, like
`len(self)` and `iter(self)`, plus extra set operations like
`recs1 + recs2`.

Iterating over `self` gives the records one by one, where each record is
itself a collection of size 1. You can access/assign fields on single
records by using the dot notation, like `record.name`.

</div>

``` python
import random
from odoo import models, fields, api

class ComputedModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'test.computed'

    name = fields.Char(compute='_compute_name')

    def _compute_name(self):
        for record in self:
            record.name = str(random.randint(1, 1e6))
```

### Dependencies

The value of a computed field usually depends on the values of other
fields on the computed record. The ORM expects the developer to specify
those dependencies on the compute method with the decorator
`~odoo.api.depends`. The given dependencies are used by the ORM to
trigger the recomputation of the field whenever some of its dependencies
have been modified:

    from odoo import models, fields, api

    class ComputedModel(models.Model):
        _name = 'test.computed'

        name = fields.Char(compute='_compute_name')
        value = fields.Integer()

        @api.depends('value')
        def _compute_name(self):
            for record in self:
                record.name = "Record with value %s" % record.value

<div class="exercise">

Computed fields

- Add the percentage of taken seats to the *Session* model
- Display that field in the tree and form views
- Display the field as a progress bar

</div>

### Default values

Any field can be given a default value. In the field definition, add the
option `default=X` where `X` is either a Python literal value (boolean,
integer, float, string), or a function taking a recordset and returning
a value:

    name = fields.Char(default="Unknown")
    user_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', default=lambda self: self.env.user)

> [!NOTE]
> The object `self.env` gives access to request parameters and other
> useful things:
>
> - `self.env.cr` or `self._cr` is the database *cursor* object; it is
>   used for querying the database
> - `self.env.uid` or `self._uid` is the current user's database id
> - `self.env.user` is the current user's record
> - `self.env.context` or `self._context` is the context dictionary
> - `self.env.ref(xml_id)` returns the record corresponding to an XML id
> - `self.env[model_name]` returns an instance of the given model

<div class="exercise">

Active objects – Default values

- Define the start_date default value as today (see
  `~odoo.fields.Date`).
- Add a field `active` in the class Session, and set sessions as active
  by default.

</div>

## Onchange

The "onchange" mechanism provides a way for the client interface to
update a form whenever the user has filled in a value in a field,
without saving anything to the database.

For instance, suppose a model has three fields `amount`, `unit_price`
and `price`, and you want to update the price on the form when any of
the other fields is modified. To achieve this, define a method where
`self` represents the record in the form view, and decorate it with
`~odoo.api.onchange` to specify on which field it has to be triggered.
Any change you make on `self` will be reflected on the form.

``` xml
<!-- content of form view -->
<field name="amount"/>
<field name="unit_price"/>
<field name="price" readonly="1"/>
```

``` python
# onchange handler
@api.onchange('amount', 'unit_price')
def _onchange_price(self):
    # set auto-changing field
    self.price = self.amount * self.unit_price
    # Can optionally return a warning and domains
    return {
        'warning': {
            'title': "Something bad happened",
            'message': "It was very bad indeed",
        }
    }
```

For computed fields, valued `onchange` behavior is built-in as can be
seen by playing with the *Session* form: change the number of seats or
participants, and the `taken_seats` progressbar is automatically
updated.

<div class="exercise">

Warning

Add an explicit onchange to warn about invalid values, like a negative
number of seats, or more participants than seats.

</div>

## Model constraints

Konvergo ERP provides two ways to set up automatically verified invariants:
`Python constraints <odoo.api.constrains>` and
`SQL constraints <odoo.models.Model._sql_constraints>`.

A Python constraint is defined as a method decorated with
`~odoo.api.constrains`, and invoked on a recordset. The decorator
specifies which fields are involved in the constraint, so that the
constraint is automatically evaluated when one of them is modified. The
method is expected to raise an exception if its invariant is not
satisfied:

    from odoo.exceptions import ValidationError

    @api.constrains('age')
    def _check_something(self):
        for record in self:
            if record.age > 20:
                raise ValidationError("Your record is too old: %s" % record.age)
        # all records passed the test, don't return anything

<div class="exercise">

Add Python constraints

Add a constraint that checks that the instructor is not present in the
attendees of his/her own session.

</div>

SQL constraints are defined through the model attribute
`~odoo.models.Model._sql_constraints`. The latter is assigned to a list
of triples of strings `(name, sql_definition, message)`, where `name` is
a valid SQL constraint name, `sql_definition` is a
[table_constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/ddl-constraints.html)
expression, and `message` is the error message.

<div class="exercise">

Add SQL constraints

With the help of [PostgreSQL's
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/ddl-constraints.html)
, add the following constraints:

1.  CHECK that the course description and the course title are different
2.  Make the Course's name UNIQUE

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Exercise 6 - Add a duplicate option

Since we added a constraint for the Course name uniqueness, it is not
possible to use the "duplicate" function anymore (`Form -->
Duplicate`).

Re-implement your own "copy" method which allows to duplicate the Course
object, changing the original name into "Copy of \[original name\]".

</div>

## Advanced Views

### Tree views

Tree views can take supplementary attributes to further customize their
behavior:

`decoration-{$name}`  
allow changing the style of a row's text based on the corresponding
record's attributes.

Values are Python expressions. For each record, the expression is
evaluated with the record's attributes as context values and if `true`,
the corresponding style is applied to the row. Here are some of the
other values available in the context:

- `uid`: the id of the current user,
- `today`: the current local date as a string of the form `YYYY-MM-DD`,
- `now`: same as `today` with the addition of the current time. This
  value is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`.

`{$name}` can be `bf` (`font-weight: bold`), `it`
(`font-style: italic`), or any [bootstrap contextual
color](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#available-variations)
(`danger`, `info`, `muted`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`).

``` xml
<tree string="Idea Categories" decoration-info="state=='draft'"
    decoration-danger="state=='trashed'">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="state"/>
</tree>
```

`editable`  
Either `"top"` or `"bottom"`. Makes the tree view editable in-place
(rather than having to go through the form view), the value is the
position where new rows appear.

<div class="exercise">

List coloring

Modify the Session tree view in such a way that sessions lasting less
than 5 days are colored blue, and the ones lasting more than 15 days are
colored red.

</div>

### Calendars

Displays records as calendar events. Their root element is `<calendar>`
and their most common attributes are:

`color`  
The name of the field used for *color segmentation*. Colors are
automatically distributed to events, but events in the same color
segment (records which have the same value for their `@color` field)
will be given the same color.

`date_start`  
record's field holding the start date/time for the event

`date_stop` (optional)  
  record's field holding the end date/time for the event

`string`  
record's field to define the label for each calendar event

``` xml
<calendar string="Ideas" date_start="invent_date" color="inventor_id">
    <field name="name"/>
</calendar>
```

<div class="exercise">

Calendar view

Add a Calendar view to the *Session* model enabling the user to view the
events associated to the Open Academy.

</div>

### Search views

Search view `<field>` elements can have a `@filter_domain` that
overrides the domain generated for searching on the given field. In the
given domain, `self` represents the value entered by the user. In the
example below, it is used to search on both fields `name` and
`description`.

Search views can also contain `<filter>` elements, which act as toggles
for predefined searches. Filters must have one of the following
attributes:

`domain`  
add the given domain to the current search

`context`  
add some context to the current search; use the key `group_by` to group
results on the given field name

``` xml
<search string="Ideas">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="description" string="Name and description"
           filter_domain="['|', ('name', 'ilike', self), ('description', 'ilike', self)]"/>
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
    <field name="country_id" widget="selection"/>

    <filter name="my_ideas" string="My Ideas"
            domain="[('inventor_id', '=', uid)]"/>
    <group string="Group By">
        <filter name="group_by_inventor" string="Inventor"
                context="{'group_by': 'inventor_id'}"/>
    </group>
</search>
```

To use a non-default search view in an action, it should be linked using
the `search_view_id` field of the action record.

The action can also set default values for search fields through its
`context` field: context keys of the form `search_default_{field_name}`
will initialize *field_name* with the provided value. Search filters
must have an optional `@name` to have a default and behave as booleans
(they can only be enabled by default).

<div class="exercise">

Search views

1.  Add a button to filter the courses for which the current user is the
    responsible in the course search view. Make it selected by default.
2.  Add a button to group courses by responsible user.

</div>

### Gantt

> [!WARNING]
> The gantt view requires the web_gantt module which is present in the
> `enterprise edition
> <install/editions>` version.

Horizontal bar charts typically used to show project planning and
advancement, their root element is `<gantt>`.

``` xml
<gantt string="Ideas"
       date_start="invent_date"
       date_stop="date_finished"
       progress="progress"
       default_group_by="inventor_id" />
```

<div class="exercise">

Gantt charts

Add a Gantt Chart enabling the user to view the sessions scheduling
linked to the Open Academy module. The sessions should be grouped by
instructor.

</div>

### Graph views

Graph views allow aggregated overview and analysis of models, their root
element is `<graph>`.

> [!NOTE]
> Pivot views (element `<pivot>`) a multidimensional table, allows the
> selection of filers and dimensions to get the right aggregated dataset
> before moving to a more graphical overview. The pivot view shares the
> same content definition as graph views.

Graph views have 4 display modes, the default mode is selected using the
`@type` attribute.

Bar (default)  
a bar chart, the first dimension is used to define groups on the
horizontal axis, other dimensions define aggregated bars within each
group.

By default bars are side-by-side, they can be stacked by using
`@stacked="True"` on the `<graph>`

Line  
2-dimensional line chart

Pie  
2-dimensional pie

Graph views contain `<field>` with a mandatory `@type` attribute taking
the values:

`row` (default)  
the field should be aggregated by default

`measure`  
the field should be aggregated rather than grouped on

``` xml
<graph string="Total idea score by Inventor">
    <field name="inventor_id"/>
    <field name="score" type="measure"/>
</graph>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Graph views perform aggregations on database values, they do not work
> with non-stored computed fields.

<div class="exercise">

Graph view

Add a Graph view in the Session object that displays, for each course,
the number of attendees under the form of a bar chart.

</div>

### Kanban

Used to organize tasks, production processes, etc… their root element is
`<kanban>`.

A kanban view shows a set of cards possibly grouped in columns. Each
card represents a record, and each column the values of an aggregation
field.

For instance, project tasks may be organized by stage (each column is a
stage), or by responsible (each column is a user), and so on.

Kanban views define the structure of each card as a mix of form elements
(including basic HTML) and `reference/qweb`.

<div class="exercise">

Kanban view

Add a Kanban view that displays sessions grouped by course (columns are
thus courses).

</div>

## Security

Access control mechanisms must be configured to achieve a coherent
security policy.

### Group-based access control mechanisms

Groups are created as normal records on the model `res.groups`, and
granted menu access via menu definitions. However even without a menu,
objects may still be accessible indirectly, so actual object-level
permissions (read, write, create, unlink) must be defined for groups.
They are usually inserted via CSV files inside modules. It is also
possible to restrict access to specific fields on a view or object using
the field's groups attribute.

### Access rights

Access rights are defined as records of the model `ir.model.access`.
Each access right is associated to a model, a group (or no group for
global access), and a set of permissions: read, write, create, unlink.
Such access rights are usually created by a CSV file named after its
model: `ir.model.access.csv`.

``` text
id,name,model_id/id,group_id/id,perm_read,perm_write,perm_create,perm_unlink
access_idea_idea,idea.idea,model_idea_idea,base.group_user,1,1,1,0
access_idea_vote,idea.vote,model_idea_vote,base.group_user,1,1,1,0
```

<div class="exercise">

Add access control through the Konvergo ERP interface

Create a new user "John Smith". Then create a group "OpenAcademy /
Session Read" with read access to the *Session* model.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Add access control through data files in your module

Using data files,

- Create a group *OpenAcademy / Manager* with full access to all
  OpenAcademy models
- Make *Session* and *Course* readable by all users

</div>

### Record rules

A record rule restricts the access rights to a subset of records of the
given model. A rule is a record of the model `ir.rule`, and is
associated to a model, a number of groups (many2many field), permissions
to which the restriction applies, and a domain. The domain specifies to
which records the access rights are limited.

Here is an example of a rule that prevents the deletion of leads that
are not in state `cancel`. Notice that the value of the field `groups`
must follow the same convention as the method `~odoo.models.Model.write`
of the ORM.

``` xml
<record id="delete_cancelled_only" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Only cancelled leads may be deleted</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="crm.model_crm_lead"/>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('sales_team.group_sale_manager'))]"/>
    <field name="perm_read" eval="0"/>
    <field name="perm_write" eval="0"/>
    <field name="perm_create" eval="0"/>
    <field name="perm_unlink" eval="1" />
    <field name="domain_force">[('state','=','cancel')]</field>
</record>
```

<div class="exercise">

Record rule

Add a record rule for the model Course and the group "OpenAcademy /
Manager", that restricts `write` and `unlink` accesses to the
responsible of a course. If a course has no responsible, all users of
the group must be able to modify it.

</div>

## Wizards

Wizards describe interactive sessions with the user (or dialog boxes)
through dynamic forms. A wizard is simply a model that extends the class
`~odoo.models.TransientModel` instead of `~odoo.models.Model`. The class
`~odoo.models.TransientModel` extends `~odoo.models.Model` and reuse all
its existing mechanisms, with the following particularities:

- Wizard records are not meant to be persistent; they are automatically
  deleted from the database after a certain time. This is why they are
  called *transient*.
- Wizard records may refer to regular records or wizard records through
  relational fields(many2one or many2many), but regular records *cannot*
  refer to wizard records through a many2one field.

We want to create a wizard that allow users to create attendees for a
particular session, or for a list of sessions at once.

<div class="exercise">

Define the wizard

Create a wizard model with a many2one relationship with the *Session*
model and a many2many relationship with the *Partner* model.

</div>

### Launching wizards

Wizards are simply `window actions <howtos/module/actions>` with a
`target` field set to the value `new`, which opens the view (usually
`a form <howtos/module/views/form>`) in a separate dialog. The action
may be triggered via a menu item, but is more generally triggered by a
button.

An other way to launch wizards is through the `Action` menu of a tree or
form view. This is done through the `binding_model_id` field of the
action. Setting this field will make the action appear on the views of
the model the action is "bound" to.

``` xml
<record id="launch_the_wizard" model="ir.actions.act_window">
    <field name="name">Launch the Wizard</field>
    <field name="res_model">wizard.model.name</field>
    <field name="view_mode">form</field>
    <field name="target">new</field>
    <field name="binding_model_id" ref="model_context_model_ref"/>
</record>
```

> [!TIP]
> While wizards use regular views and buttons, normally clicking any
> button in a form would first save the form then close the dialog.
> Because this is often undesirable in wizards, a special attribute
> `special="cancel"` is available which immediately closes the wizard
> without saving the form.

<div class="exercise">

Launch the wizard

1.  Define a form view for the wizard.
2.  Add the action to launch it in the context of the *Session* model.
3.  Define a default value for the session field in the wizard; use the
    context parameter `self._context` to retrieve the current session.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Register attendees

Add buttons to the wizard, and implement the corresponding method for
adding the attendees to the given session.

</div>

<div class="exercise">

Register attendees to multiple sessions

Modify the wizard model so that attendees can be registered to multiple
sessions.

</div>

## Internationalization

Each module can provide its own translations within the i18n directory,
by having files named LANG.po where LANG is the locale code for the
language, or the language and country combination when they differ (e.g.
pt.po or pt_BR.po). Translations will be loaded automatically by Konvergo ERP
for all enabled languages. Developers always use English when creating a
module, then export the module terms using Konvergo ERP's gettext POT export
feature (`Settings --> Translations --> Import/Export --> Export
Translation` without specifying a language), to create the module
template POT file, and then derive the translated PO files. Many IDE's
have plugins or modes for editing and merging PO/POT files.

> [!TIP]
> The Portable Object files generated by Konvergo ERP are published on
> [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/odoo/public/), making it easy to
> translate the software.

``` text
|- idea/ # The module directory
   |- i18n/ # Translation files
      | - idea.pot # Translation Template (exported from Konvergo ERP)
      | - fr.po # French translation
      | - pt_BR.po # Brazilian Portuguese translation
      | (...)
```

> [!TIP]
> By default Konvergo ERP's POT export only extracts labels inside XML files or
> inside field definitions in Python code, but any Python string can be
> translated this way by surrounding it with the function `odoo._` (e.g.
> `_("Label")`)

<div class="exercise">

Translate a module

Choose a second language for your Konvergo ERP installation. Translate your
module using the facilities provided by Konvergo ERP.

## Reporting

### Printed reports

Konvergo ERP uses a report engine based on `reference/qweb`, [Twitter
Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and
[Wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org).

A report is a combination two elements:

- an `ir.actions.report` which configures various basic parameters for
  the report (default type, whether the report should be saved to the
  database after generation,…)

  ``` xml
  <record id="account_invoices" model="ir.actions.report">
      <field name="name">Invoices</field>
      <field name="model">account.invoice</field>
      <field name="report_type">qweb-pdf</field>
      <field name="report_name">account.report_invoice</field>
      <field name="report_file">account.report_invoice</field>
      <field name="attachment_use" eval="True"/>
      <field name="attachment">(object.state in ('open','paid')) and
          ('INV'+(object.number or '').replace('/','')+'.pdf')</field>
      <field name="binding_model_id" ref="model_account_invoice"/>
      <field name="binding_type">report</field>
  </record>
  ```

  > [!TIP]
  > Because it largerly a standard action, as with `howto/module/wizard`
  > it is generally useful to add the report as a *contextual item* on
  > the tree and / or form views of the model being reported on via the
  > `binding_model_id` field.
  >
  > Here we are also using `binding_type` in order for the report to be
  > in the *report* contextual menu rather than the *action* one. There
  > is no technical difference but putting elements in the right place
  > helps users.

- A standard `QWeb view <reference/views/qweb>` for the actual report:

  ``` xml
  <t t-call="web.html_container">
      <t t-foreach="docs" t-as="o">
          <t t-call="web.external_layout">
              <div class="page">
                  <h2>Report title</h2>
              </div>
          </t>
      </t>
  </t>
  ```

  the standard rendering context provides a number of elements, the most
  important being:

  `docs`  
  the records for which the report is printed

  `user`  
  the user printing the report

Because reports are standard web pages, they are available through a URL
and output parameters can be manipulated through this URL, for instance
the HTML version of the *Invoice* report is available through
<http://localhost:8069/report/html/account.report_invoice/1> (if
`account` is installed) and the PDF version through
<http://localhost:8069/report/pdf/account.report_invoice/1>.

<div id="reference/backend/reporting/printed-reports/pdf-without-styles">

<div class="danger">

<div class="title">

Danger

</div>

If it appears that your PDF report is missing the styles (i.e. the text
appears but the style/layout is different from the html version),
probably your [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org) process cannot
reach your web server to download them.

If you check your server logs and see that the CSS styles are not being
downloaded when generating a PDF report, most surely this is the
problem.

The [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org) process will use the
`web.base.url` system parameter as the *root path* to all linked files,
but this parameter is automatically updated each time the Administrator
is logged in. If your server resides behind some kind of proxy, that
could not be reachable. You can fix this by adding one of these system
parameters:

- `report.url`, pointing to an URL reachable from your server (probably
  `http://localhost:8069` or something similar). It will be used for
  this particular purpose only.
- `web.base.url.freeze`, when set to `True`, will stop the automatic
  updates to `web.base.url`.
