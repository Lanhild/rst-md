# Animations

Eye-catching animations can bring your website to life.

## On appearance

In standard, you can add animations to columns when they appear, thanks
to the Website Builder. Konvergo ERP detects when your element is in the
viewport and launches the animation. A large selection of animations is
available:

- Fade in
- Bounce in
- Rotate in
- Zoom in
- …

You can easily define an animation on a column in your custom theme. You
need to add two classes: <span class="title-ref">o_animate</span> and
<span class="title-ref">o_anim_fade_in</span>. The second class changes
depending on the type of animation you want to use.

Add the <span class="title-ref">o_animate_both_scroll</span> class to
launch the animation every time the column appears on the screen. The
animation is only launched once by default.

You can also define an <span class="title-ref">animation-duration</span>
and an <span class="title-ref">animation-delay</span> directly in the
<span class="title-ref">style</span> attribute.

**Use**

``` xml
<div class="col-lg-6 o_animate o_anim_fade_in o_animate_both_scroll" style="animation-duration: 2s !important; animation-delay: 1s !important;">
    <h2>A Section Subtitle</h2>
    <p>Write one or two paragraphs describing your product or services.</p>
</div>
```
