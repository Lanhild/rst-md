# Upgrade a customized database

Upgrading to a new version of Konvergo ERP can be challenging, especially if the
database you work on contains custom modules. This page intent is to
explain the technical process of upgrading a database with customized
modules. Refer to `Upgrade documentation </administration/upgrade>` for
guidance on how to upgrade a database without customized modules.

We consider a custom module, any module that extends the standard code
of Konvergo ERP and that was not built with the Studio app. Before upgrading
such a module, or before requesting its upgrade, have a look at the
`upgrade/sla` to make sure who's responsible for it.

While working on what we refer to as the **custom upgrade** of your
database, keep in mind the goals of an upgrade:

1.  Stay supported
2.  Get the latest features
3.  Enjoy the performance improvement
4.  Reduce the technical debt
5.  Benefit from security improvements

With every new version of Konvergo ERP, changes are introduced. These changes
can impact modules on which customization have been developed. This is
the reason why upgrading a database that contains custom modules
requires additional steps in order to upgrade the source code.

These are the steps to follow to upgrade customized databases:

1.  `Stop the devolopments and challenge them <upgrade_custom/stop_developments>`.
2.  `Request an upgraded database <upgrade_custom/request_upgrade>`.
3.  `Make your module installable on an empty database <upgrade_custom/empty_database>`.
4.  `Make your module installable on the upgraded database <upgrade_custom/upgraded_database>`.
5.  `Test extensively and do a rehearsal <upgrade_custom/testing_rehearsal>`.
6.  `Upgrade the production database <upgrade_custom/production>`.

## Step 1: Stop the developments

Starting an upgrade requires commitment and development resources. If
developments keep being made at the same time, those features will need
to be re-upgraded and tested every time you change them. This is why we
recommend a complete freeze of the codebase when starting the upgrade
process. Needless to say, bug fixing is exempt from this recommendation.

Once you have stopped development, it is a good practice to assess the
developments made and compare them with the features introduced between
your current version and the version you are targeting. Challenge the
developments as much as possible and find functional workarounds.
Removing redundancy between your developments and the standard version
of Konvergo ERP will lead to an eased upgrade process and reduce technical debt.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find information on the changes between versions in the
> [Release Notes](https:/odoo.com/page/release-notes).

## Step 2: Request an upgraded database

Once the developments have stopped for the custom modules and the
implemented features have been challenged to remove redundancy and
unnecessary code, the next step is to request an upgraded test database.
To do so, follow the steps mentioned in `upgrade/request-test-database`,
depending on the hosting type of your database.

The purpose of this stage is not to start working with the custom
modules in the upgraded database, but to make sure the standard upgrade
process works seamlessly, and the test database is delivered properly.
If that's not the case, and the upgrade request fails, request the
assistance of Konvergo ERP via the [support
page](https://odoo.com/help?stage=migration) by selecting the option
related to testing the upgrade.

## Step 3: Empty database

Before working on an upgraded test database, we recommend to make the
custom developments work on an empty database in the targeted version of
your upgrade. This ensures that the customization is compatible with the
new version of Konvergo ERP, allows to analyze how it behaves and interacts with
the new features, and guarantees that they will not cause any issues
when upgrading the database.

Making the custom modules work in an empty database also helps avoid
changes and wrong configurations that might be present in the production
database (like studio customization, customized website pages, email
templates or translations). They are not intrinsically related to the
custom modules and that can raise unwanted issues in this stage of the
upgrade process.

To make custom modules work on an empty database we advise to follow
these steps:

1.  `upgrade_custom/empty_database/modules_installable`
2.  `upgrade_custom/empty_database/test_fixes`
3.  `upgrade_custom/empty_database/clean_code`
4.  `Make standard tests run successfully <upgrade_custom/empty_database/standard_test>`

### Make custom modules installable

The first step is to make the custom modules installable in the new Konvergo ERP
version. This means, starting by ensuring there are no tracebacks or
warnings during their installation. For this, install the custom
modules, one by one, in an empty database of the new Konvergo ERP version and
fix the tracebacks and warnings that arise from that.

This process will help detect issues during the installation of the
modules. For example:

- Invalid module dependencies.
- Syntax change: assets declaration, OWL updates, attrs.
- References to standard fields, models, views not existing anymore or
  renamed.
- Xpath that moved or were removed from views.
- Methods renamed or removed.
- ...

### Test and fixes

Once there are no more tracebacks when installing the modules, the next
step is to test them. Even if the custom modules are installable on an
empty database, this does not guarantee there are no errors during their
execution. Because of this, we encourage to test thoroughly all the
customization to make sure everything is working as expected.

This process will help detect further issues that are not identified
during the module installation and can only be detected in runtime. For
example, deprecated calls to standard python or OWL functions,
non-existing references to standard fields, etc.

We recommend to test all the customization, especially the following
elements:

- Views
- Email templates
- Reports
- Server actions and automated actions
- Changes in the standard workflows
- Computed fields

We also encourage to write automated tests to save time during the
testing iterations, increase the test coverage, and ensure that the
changes and fixes introduced do not break the existing flows. If there
are tests already implemented in the customization, make sure they are
upgraded to the new Konvergo ERP version and run successfully, fixing issues
that might be present.

### Clean the code

At this stage of the upgrade process, we also suggest to clean the code
as much as possible. This includes:

- Remove redundant and unnecessary code.
- Remove features that are now part of Konvergo ERP standard, as described in
  `upgrade_custom/stop_developments`.
- Clean commented code if it is not needed anymore.
- Refactor the code (functions, fields, views, reports, etc.) if needed.

### Standard tests

Once the previous steps are completed, we advise to make sure all
standard tests associated to the dependencies of the custom module pass.
Standard tests ensure the validation of the code logic and prevent data
corruption. They will help you identify bugs or unwanted behavior before
you work on your database.

In case there are standard test failing, we suggest to analyze the
reason for their failure:

- The customization changes the standard workflow: Adapt the standard
  test to your workflow.
- The customization did not take into account a special flow: Adapt your
  customization to ensure it works for all the standard workflows.

## Step 4: Upgraded database

Once the custom modules are installable and working properly in an empty
database, it is time to make them work on an
`upgraded database <upgrade/request-test-database>`.

To make sure the custom code is working flawlessly in the new version,
follow these steps:

- `upgrade_custom/upgraded_database/migrate_data`
- `upgrade_custom/upgraded_database/test_custom`

### Migrate the data

During the upgrade of the custom modules, you might have to use
`upgrade scripts
<../reference/upgrades/upgrade_scripts>` to reflect changes from the
source code to their corresponding data. Together with the upgrade
scripts, you can also make use of the
`../reference/upgrades/upgrade_utils` and its helper functions.

- Any technical data that was renamed during the upgrade of the custom
  code (models, fields, external identifiers) should be renamed using
  upgrade scripts to avoid data loss during the module upgrade. See
  also: `rename_field`, `rename_model`, `rename_xmlid`.

- Data from standard models removed from the source code of the newer
  Konvergo ERP version and from the database during the standard upgrade process
  might need to be recovered from the old model table if it is still
  present.

  > <div class="example">
  >
  > Custom fields for model `sale.subscription` are not automatically
  > migrated from Konvergo ERP 15 to Konvergo ERP 16 (when the model was merged into
  > `sale.order`). In this case, a SQL query can be executed on an
  > upgrade script to move the data from one table to the other. Take
  > into account that all columns/fields must already exist, so consider
  > doing this in a `post-` script (See `upgrade-scripts/phases`).
  >
  > <div class="spoiler">
  >
  > ``` python
  > def migrate(cr, version):
  >    cr.execute(
  >       """
  >       UPDATE sale_order so
  >          SET custom_field = ss.custom_field
  >         FROM sale_subscription ss
  >        WHERE ss.new_sale_order_id = so.id
  >       """
  >    )
  > ```
  >
  > Check the documentation for more information on
  > `../reference/upgrades/upgrade_scripts`.
  >
  > </div>
  >
  > </div>

Upgrade scripts can also be used to:

- Ease the processing time of an upgrade. For example, to store the
  value of computed stored fields on models with an excessive number of
  records by using SQL queries.
- Recompute fields in case the computation of their value has changed.
  See also `recompute_fields`.
- Uninstall unwanted custom modules. See also `remove_module`.
- Correct faulty data or wrong configurations.

#### Running and testing upgrade scripts

<div class="tabs">

<div class="group-tab">

Konvergo ERP Online

As the instalation of custom modules containing Python files is not
allowed on Konvergo ERP Online databases, it is not possible to run upgrade
scripts on this platform.

</div>

<div class="group-tab">

Konvergo ERP.sh

As explained on the <span class="title-ref">Konvergo ERP.sh</span> tab of
`upgrade/request-test-database`, Konvergo ERP.sh is integrated with the upgrade
platform.

Once the upgrade of a staging branch is on "Update on commit" mode, each
time a commit is pushed on the branch, the upgraded backup is restored
and all the custom modules are updated. This update includes the
execution of the upgrade scripts.

When upgrading the production database, the execution of the upgrade
scripts is also part of the update of the custom modules done by the
platform when the upgraded database is restored.

</div>

<div class="group-tab">

On-premise

Once you receive the upgraded dump of the database from the [Upgrade
platform](https://upgrade.odoo.com), deploy the database and update all
the custom modules by invoking the command
`odoo-bin </developer/reference/cli>` in the shell. To update the custom
modules, use the option: <span class="title-ref">-u \<modules\>,
--update \<modules\></span>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As mentioned in the `CLI documentation </developer/reference/cli>`,
> the command used to call the CLI depends on how you installed Konvergo ERP.

</div>

</div>

### Test the custom modules

To make sure the custom modules work properly with your data in the
upgraded database, they need to be tested as well. This helps ensure
both the standard and the custom data stored in the database are
consistent and that nothing was lost during the upgrade process.

Things to pay attention to:

- Views not working: During the upgrade, if a view causes issues because
  of its content, it gets disabled. You can find the information on
  disabled views on the `Upgrade report
  <upgrade/upgrade_report>`. This view needs to be activated again (or
  removed if not useful anymore). To achieve this, we recommend the use
  of upgrade scripts.
- `Module data <../tutorials/define_module_data>` not updated: Custom
  records that have the `noupdate` flag are not updated when upgrading
  the module in the new database. For the custom data that needs to be
  updated due to changes in the new version, we recommend to use upgrade
  scripts to do so. See also: `update_record_from_xml`.

## Step 5: Testing and rehearsal

When the custom modules are working properly in the upgraded database,
it is crucial to do another round of testing to assess the database
usability and detect any issues that might have gone unnoticed in
previous tests. For further information about testing the upgraded
database, check `upgrade/test_your_db`.

As mentioned in `upgrade/upgrade-prod`, both standard upgrade scripts
and your database are constantly evolving. Therefore it is highly
recommended to frequently request new upgraded test databases and ensure
that the upgrade process is still successful.

In addition to that, make a full rehearsal of the upgrade process the
day before upgrading the production database to avoid undesired behavior
during the upgrade and to detect any issue that might have occurred with
the migrated data.

## Step 6: Production upgrade

Once you are confident about upgrading your production database, follow
the process described on `upgrade/upgrade-prod`, depending on the
hosting type of your database.
