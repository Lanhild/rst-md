The Konvergo ERP Website Builder is an excellent tool for creating a website
fully integrated with other Konvergo ERP apps. Using the theme's options and
building blocks is easy and allows you to personalize your web presence
the way you want. However, you can take things even further.

In this documentation, you will learn to completely customize your
website without touching Konvergo ERP's core files, and this way, preserve the
editing options of the Website Builder.

The information compiled in this documentation is based on our past
experiences - both failures and successes. We invite you to use it as a
base to build your own website and adapt it to your needs.
