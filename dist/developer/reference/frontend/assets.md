# Assets

Managing assets in Konvergo ERP is not as straightforward as it is in some other
apps. One of the reasons is that we have a variety of situations where
some, but not all of the assets are required. For example, the needs of
the web client, the point of sale app, the website or even the mobile
application are different. Also, some assets may be large, but are
seldom needed: in that case we may want them to be
`loaded lazily (on demand) <frontend/assets/lazy_loading>`.

## Asset types

There are three different asset types: code
(<span class="title-ref">js</span> files), style
(<span class="title-ref">css</span> or
<span class="title-ref">scss</span> files) and templates
(<span class="title-ref">xml</span> files).

Code  
Konvergo ERP supports
`three different kinds of javascript files<frontend/js_modules>`. All
these files are then processed (native JS modules are transformed into
odoo modules), then minified (if not in
<span class="title-ref">debug=assets</span>
`mode <frontend/framework/assets_debug_mode>`) and concatenated. The
result is then saved as a file attachment. These file attachments are
usually loaded via a <span class="title-ref">\<script\></span> tag in
the <span class="title-ref">\<head\></span> part of the page (as a
static file).

Style  
Styling can be done with either <span class="title-ref">css</span> or
[scss](https://sass-lang.com/). Like the javascript files, these files
are processed (<span class="title-ref">scss</span> files are converted
into <span class="title-ref">css</span>), then minified (again, if not
in <span class="title-ref">debug=assets</span>
`mode <frontend/framework/assets_debug_mode>`) and concatenated. The
result is then saved as a file attachment. They are then usually loaded
via a <span class="title-ref">\<link\></span> tag in the
<span class="title-ref">\<head\></span> part of the page (as a static
file).

Template  
Templates (static <span class="title-ref">xml</span> files) are handled
in a different way: they are simply read from the file system whenever
they are needed, and concatenated.

Whenever the browser loads odoo, it calls the
<span class="title-ref">/web/webclient/qweb/</span> controller to fetch
the `templates <reference/qweb>`.

It is useful to know that in most cases, a browser only performs a
request the first time it loads a page. This is because each of these
assets are associated with a checksum, which is injected into the page
source. The checksum is then added to the url, which means that it is
possible to safely set the cache headers to a long period.

## Bundles

Konvergo ERP assets are grouped by *bundles*. Each bundle (a *list of file
paths* of specific types: <span class="title-ref">xml</span>,
<span class="title-ref">js</span>, <span class="title-ref">css</span> or
<span class="title-ref">scss</span>) is listed in the
`module manifest <reference/module/manifest>`. Files can be declared
using [glob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) syntax,
meaning that you can declare several asset files using a single line.

The bundles are defined in each module's `__manifest__.py`, with a
dedicated <span class="title-ref">assets</span> key which contains a
dictionary. The dictionary maps bundle names (keys) to the list of files
they contain (values). It looks like this:

``` python
'assets': {
    'web.assets_backend': [
        'web/static/src/xml/**/*',
    ],
    'web.assets_common': [
        'web/static/lib/bootstrap/**/*',
        'web/static/src/js/boot.js',
        'web/static/src/js/webclient.js',
    ],
    'web.qunit_suite_tests': [
        'web/static/src/js/webclient_tests.js',
    ],
},
```

Here is a list of some important bundles that most odoo developers will
need to know:

- \`web.assets_common\`: this bundle contains most assets which are
  common to the web client, the website and also the point of sale. This
  is supposed to contain lower level building blocks for the odoo
  framework. Note that it contains the `boot.js` file, which defines the
  odoo module system.
- \`web.assets_backend\`: this bundle contains the code specific to the
  web client (notably the web client/action manager/views/static XML
  templates)
- \`web.assets_frontend\`: this bundle is about all that is specific to
  the public website: ecommerce, portal, forum, blog, ...
- \`web.qunit_suite_tests\`: all javascript qunit testing code (tests,
  helpers, mocks)
- \`web.qunit_mobile_suite_tests\`: mobile specific qunit testing code

### Operations

Typically, handling assets is simple: you just need to add some new
files to a frequently used bundle like
<span class="title-ref">assets_common</span> or
<span class="title-ref">assets_backend</span>. But there are other
operations available to cover some more specific use cases.

Note that all directives targeting a certain asset file (i.e.
<span class="title-ref">before</span>,
<span class="title-ref">after</span>,
<span class="title-ref">replace</span> and
<span class="title-ref">remove</span>) need that file to be declared
beforehand, either in manifests higher up in the hierarchy or in
`ir.asset` records with a lower sequence.

#### <span class="title-ref">append</span>

This operation adds one or multiple file(s). Since it is the most common
operation, it can be done by simply using the file name:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    'my_addon/static/src/js/**/*',
],
```

By default, adding a simple string to a bundle will append the files
matching the glob pattern at the end of the bundle. Obviously, the
pattern may also be directly a single file path.

#### <span class="title-ref">prepend</span>

Add one or multiple file(s) at the beginning of the bundle.

Useful when you need to put a certain file before the others in a bundle
(for example with css files). The <span class="title-ref">prepend</span>
operation is invoked with the following syntax:
<span class="title-ref">('prepend', \<path\>)</span>.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('prepend', 'my_addon/static/src/css/bootstrap_overridden.scss'),
],
```

#### <span class="title-ref">before</span>

Add one or multiple file(s) before a specific file.

Prepending a file at the beginning of a bundle might not be precise
enough. The <span class="title-ref">before</span> directive can be used
to add the given file(s) right *before* the target file. It is declared
by replacing the normal path with a 3-element tuple
<span class="title-ref">('before', \<target\>, \<path\>)</span>.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('before', 'web/static/src/css/bootstrap_overridden.scss', 'my_addon/static/src/css/bootstrap_overridden.scss'),
],
```

#### <span class="title-ref">after</span>

Add one or multiple file(s) after a specific file.

Same as <span class="title-ref">before</span>, with the matching file(s)
appended right *after* the target file. It is declared by replacing the
normal path with a 3-element tuple <span class="title-ref">('after',
\<target\>, \<path\>)</span>.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('after', 'web/static/src/css/list_view.scss', 'my_addon/static/src/css/list_view.scss'),
],
```

#### <span class="title-ref">include</span>

Use nested bundles.

The <span class="title-ref">include</span> directive is a way to use a
bundle in other bundles to minimize the size of your manifest. In Konvergo ERP
we use sub bundles (prefixed with an underscore by convention) to batch
files used in multiple other bundles. You can then specify the sub
bundle as a pair <span class="title-ref">('include', \<bundle\>)</span>
like this:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('include', 'web._primary_variables'),
],
```

#### <span class="title-ref">remove</span>

Remove one or multiple file(s).

In some cases, you may want to remove one or multiple files from a
bundle. This can be done using the <span class="title-ref">remove</span>
directive by specifying a pair \`('remove', \<target\>)\`:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('remove', 'web/static/src/js/boot.js'),
],
```

#### <span class="title-ref">replace</span>

Replace an asset file with one or multiple file(s).

Let us say that an asset needs not only to be removed, but you also want
to insert your new version of that asset at the same exact position.
This can be done with the <span class="title-ref">replace</span>
directive, using a 3-element tuple \`('replace', \<target\>,
\<path\>)\`:

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    ('replace', 'web/static/src/js/boot.js', 'my_addon/static/src/js/boot.js'),
],
```

### Loading order

The order in which assets are loaded is sometimes critical and must be
deterministic, mostly for stylesheets priorities and setup scripts.
Assets in Konvergo ERP are processed as follows:

1.  When an asset bundle is called (e.g.
    <span class="title-ref">t-call-assets="web.assets_common"</span>),
    an empty list of assets is generated
2.  All records of type <span class="title-ref">ir.asset</span> matching
    the bundle are fetched and sorted by sequence number. Then all
    records with a sequence strictly less than 16 are processed and
    applied to the current list of assets.
3.  All modules declaring assets for said bundle in their manifest apply
    their assets operations to this list. This is done following the
    order of modules dependencies (e.g.
    <span class="title-ref">web</span> assets is processed before
    <span class="title-ref">website</span>). If a directive tries to add
    a file already present in the list, nothing is done for that file.
    In other word, only the first occurrence of a file is kept in the
    list.
4.  The remaining <span class="title-ref">ir.asset</span> records (those
    with a sequence greater than or equal to 16) are then processed and
    applied as well.

Assets declared in the manifest may need to be loaded in a particular
order, for example `jquery.js` must be loaded before all other jquery
scripts when loading the lib folder. One solution would be to create an
`ir.asset <frontend/assets/ir_asset>` record with a lower sequence or a
'prepend' directive, but there is another simpler way to do so.

Since the unicity of each file path in the list of assets is guaranteed,
you can mention any specific file before a glob that includes it. That
file will thus appear in the list before all the others included in the
glob.

``` python
'web.assets_common': [
    'my_addon/static/lib/jquery/jquery.js',
    'my_addon/static/lib/jquery/**/*',
],
```

> [!NOTE]
> A module *b* removing/replacing the assets declared in a module *a*
> will have to depend on it. Trying to operate on assets that have yet
> to be declared will result in an error.

## Lazy loading

It is sometimes useful to load files and/or asset bundles dynamically,
for example to only load a library once it is needed. To do that, the
Konvergo ERP framework provides a few helper functions, located in
`@web/core/assets`.

``` javascript
await loadAssets({
    jsLibs: ["/web/static/lib/stacktracejs/stacktrace.js"],
});
```

> param Object assets  
> a description of various assets that should be loaded
>
> returns  
> Promise\<void\>
>
> Load the assets described by the <span class="title-ref">assets</span>
> parameter. It is an object that may contain the following keys:
>
> | Key                                    | Type                                      | Description                        |
> |----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
> | <span class="title-ref">jsLibs</span>  | <span class="title-ref">string\[\]</span> | a list of urls of javascript files |
> | <span class="title-ref">cssLibs</span> | <span class="title-ref">string\[\]</span> | a list of urls of css files        |

> param Object assets  
> a description of various assets that should be loaded
>
> This hook is useful when components need to load some assets in their
> <span class="title-ref">onWillStart</span> method. It internally calls
> <span class="title-ref">loadAssets</span>.

## The asset model (<span class="title-ref">ir.asset</span>)

In most cases the assets declared in the manifest will largely suffice.
Yet for more flexibility, the framework also supports dynamic assets
declared in the database.

This is done by creating <span class="title-ref">ir.asset</span>
records. Those will be processed as if they were found in a module
manifest, and they give the same expressive power as their manifest
counterparts.

<div class="autoclass">

odoo.addons.base.models.ir_asset.IrAsset

</div>

<div class="rst-class">

o-definition-list

</div>

<span class="title-ref">name</span>  
Name of the asset record (for identification purpose).

<span class="title-ref">bundle</span>  
Bundle in which the asset will be applied.

<span class="title-ref">directive</span> (default= <span class="title-ref">append</span>)  
This field determines how the <span class="title-ref">path</span> (and
<span class="title-ref">target</span> if needed) will be interpreted.
Here is the list of available directives along with their required
arguments:

- **append**: <span class="title-ref">path</span>
- **prepend**: <span class="title-ref">path</span>
- **before**: <span class="title-ref">target</span>,
  <span class="title-ref">path</span>
- **after**: <span class="title-ref">target</span>,
  <span class="title-ref">path</span>
- **include**: <span class="title-ref">path</span> (interpreted as a
  **bundle name**)
- **remove**: <span class="title-ref">path</span> (interpreted as a
  **target asset** to remove)
- **replace**: <span class="title-ref">target</span>,
  <span class="title-ref">path</span>

<span class="title-ref">path</span>  
A string defining one of the following:

- a **relative path** to an asset file in the addons file system;
- a **glob pattern** to a set of asset files in the addons file system;
- a **URL** to an attachment or external asset file;
- a **bundle name**, when using the
  <span class="title-ref">include</span> directive.

<span class="title-ref">target</span>  
Target file to specify a position in the bundle. Can only be used with
the directives <span class="title-ref">replace</span>,
<span class="title-ref">before</span> and
<span class="title-ref">after</span>.

<span class="title-ref">active</span> (default= <span class="title-ref">True</span>)  
Whether the record is active

<span class="title-ref">sequence</span> (default= <span class="title-ref">16</span>)  
Loading order of the asset records (ascending). A sequence lower than 16
means that the asset will be processed *before* the ones declared in the
manifest.
