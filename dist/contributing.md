> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is mainly Odoo employees who develop new features for the codebase
> and write new content for the documentation. Be sure to discuss any
> idea for a new feature or page with the Odoo team so they can give you
> the green light before you begin working on it. Some features may
> already be in development on their side, and only approved features
> can be merged.
