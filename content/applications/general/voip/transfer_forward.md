# Make, receive, transfer, and forward calls

Calling prospective clients, customers, or colleagues is an essential
part of any business. A company also needs to be available when
customers call, in order to build trust and make connections.

This document covers how to make, receive, transfer, and forward calls
with Odoo *VoIP*.

## Make calls

Starting on the Odoo dashboard, a call can be made by opening the phone
widget in the the upper-right corner, which is represented by a `üìû
(phone)` icon.

Then, a user can click on the `Contacts` tab, and click into any contact
in the database to make a call.

Additionally, one can also use the `Search bar` in the `VOIP` pop-up
window to find any desired contact.

To manually make a call, click the `‚å®Ô∏è (keyboard)` icon, and proceed to
manually key in the desired number. Do not forget to lead with the `+
(plus)` icon, followed by the international country code.

<div class="example">

For the United States of America, the country code and `+ (plus)` icon,
would look like this: <span class="title-ref">+1</span>. If one were to
dial Belgium, the number would be prefixed by
<span class="title-ref">+32</span>, and for Great Britain it would be
<span class="title-ref">+44</span>.

</div>

After entering the full number, with the required `+ (plus)` icon prefix
and country code, click the green `üìû (phone)` icon to start the call.
When finished, click the red `üìû (phone)` icon to end the call.

## Receive calls

An incoming call automatically opens the *VoIP* widget, when a user is
using the Odoo database. Should the database be open in another tab, a
sound plays (the sound **must** be activated on the device).

Once back to the tab, the calling screen of the *VoIP* phone widget
appears.

Click the green `üìû (phone)` icon to pick up the call, or the red `üìû
(phone)` icon to reject the call.

buttons highlighted.](transfer_forward/incoming-call.png)

## Add to call queue

All the contacts and customers that need to be called can be seen in one
place with the Odoo *VoIP* phone widget, under the `Next activities`
tab.

below.](transfer_forward/next-activities.png)

To add a call to the `Next activities` tab, click the green `üìû (phone)`
icon, while in kanban view of the *CRM* application.

To remove them from the call queue, hover over the opportunity that has
a call scheduled, and click the red `üìû (phone)` icon that appears with
the `- (minus)` icon.

When navigating back to the *VoIP* phone widget, **only** the calls that
are scheduled immediately for that day appear in the queue under the
`Next Activities` tab of the *VoIP* pop-up widget.

widget.](transfer_forward/add-call-queue.png)

The `Next Activities` tab of the *VoIP* phone widget is integrated with
the following Odoo apps: *CRM*, *Project*, and *Helpdesk*.

A call can be added in the chatter of records within those applications.

To manually add a call, via the chatter, click `Activities` (next to the
`üïó
(clock)` icon). Under `Activity Type`, select `Call` from the drop-down
menu that appears.

Next, set a `Due Date`, and add a `Summary`.

Lastly, change the `Assigned to` field to the person that should make
the call. Whomever is set in this last field (`Assigned to`) has this
call show up in their `Next
Activities` call queue in the Odoo *VoIP* phone widget.

</div>

Only calls for the immediate day (today's date) appear in the `Next
Activities` tab of the *VoIP* phone widget for that specific user.

</div>

If specified, click `Save` or `Open Calendar` to complete the scheduling
of the call.

## Transfer calls

A call can be transferred from one user to another in the Odoo *VoIP*
phone widget. However, this can **only** occur after speaking to the
caller first. Without picking up the call in the Odoo *VoIP* phone
widget, the only way to transfer a call is automatically though the
provider console/portal.

To transfer a call within the Odoo *VoIP* phone widget, first, answer
the call using the green `üìû (phone)` icon.

Once the incoming call is answered, click the `‚Üî (left-right arrow)`
icon. Then, enter the extension of the user the call should be forwarded
to. Finally, click `Transfer` to route the call to that phone number.
