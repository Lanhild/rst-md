# Advanced Use Cases: Views

  - **Case scenario 1: in Sales, show orders in a Kanban View instead of
    a List View.**

From the Sales page, access Studio and, under *Views*, set the *Kanban*
option as the default one.

  - **Case scenario 2: allow for the list of leads to be edited inline
    without having to switch to the form view.**

On the *List View*, under *View* \> *Editable*, choose between *New
record on top* or *New record at the bottom*. This way, besides defining
the order in which new records are displayed in the view, you are able
to edit them.  
If the field is left blank, no editing is possible and records are shown
based on your column preferences on the lead's page (front-end).
