# Ratings

Allow customers to rate their experience with your helpdesk teams to
strengthen your credibility and gain their trust. Reviews can also
influence a customer’s decision and open space for feedback that can
help you improve the quality of your services.

## Set up

Go to `Helpdesk --> Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams` and enable
*Ratings on tickets*. The feature automatically adds a default email
template on the non-folded *closing stage(s)* of that team.

To edit the email template and the stage(s) set as the closing ones, go
to the Kanban view of your helpdesk team and click on *Settings*, then
on *Edit Stage*.

Now, once a ticket reaches the stage(s) designated as the *Closing
Stage*, an email is sent to the customer.

Customer Satisfaction* link on the main dashboard, and through
*Reporting*.

team’s name on their ticket, customers can see its ratings.
