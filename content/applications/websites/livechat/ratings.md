# Ratings

Giving users the opportunity to rate their interactions can help you
improving the experience you offer. That means staying on top of your
customers' needs, besides keeping track of your operators’ performances.

## Customer Rating

Once the user chooses to close the chat window, he can rate his
interaction.  
If the user is *Not satisfied* or *Highly dissatisfied*, a field
allowing for an explanation is shown.  
A copy of the conversation can also be sent by email.

The rating is shown on the chat window itself for the operator.
