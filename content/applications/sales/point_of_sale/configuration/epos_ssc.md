# Self-signed certificate for ePOS printers

ePOS printers are designed to work seamlessly with Point of Sale
systems. Once connected, the two devices automatically share
information, enabling the direct printing of tickets from the POS system
to the ePOS printer.

These [Epson ePOS
printers](https://c4b.epson-biz.com/modules/community/index.php?content_id=91)
are compatible with Odoo:

  - TM-H6000IV-DT (Receipt printer only)
  - TM-T70II-DT
  - TM-T88V-DT
  - TM-L90-i
  - TM-T20II-i
  - TM-T70-i
  - TM-T82II-i
  - TM-T83II-i
  - TM-T88V-i
  - TM-U220-i
  - TM-m10
  - TM-m30
  - TM-P20 (Wi-Fi速 model)
  - TM-P60II (Receipt: Wi-Fi速 model)
  - TM-P60II (Peeler: Wi-Fi速 model)
  - TM-P80 (Wi-Fi速 model)

</div>

To work with Odoo, some models that can be used without an `IoT box
<../../../productivity/iot/config/connect>` may require `the HTTPS
protocol
<https>` to establish a secure connection between the browser and the
printer. However, trying to reach the printer's IP address using HTTPS
leads to a warning page on most web browsers. In that case, you can
temporarily `force the connection <epos_ssc/instructions>`, which allows
you to reach the page in HTTPS and use the ePOS printer in Odoo as long
as the browser window stays open.

<div class="title">

The connection is lost after closing the browser window. Therefore, this
method should only be used as a **workaround** or as a pre-requisite for
the `following instructions
<epos_ssc/instructions>`.

## Generate, export, and import self-signed certificates

For a long-term solution, you must generate a **self-signed
certificate**. Then, export and import it into your browser.

<div class="important">

</div>

**Generating** an SSL certificate should only be done **once**. If you
create another certificate, devices using the previous one will lose
HTTPS access.

Generate a self-signed certificate

Navigate to the ePOS' IP address (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">https://192.168.1.25</span>) and force the
connection by clicking `Advanced` and `Proceed to [IP address]
(unsafe)`.

![Warning page on Google Chrome, Windows
10](epos_ssc/browser-https-insecure.png)

Then, sign in using your printer credentials to access the ePOS printer
settings. To sign in, enter <span class="title-ref">epson</span> in the
`ID` field and your printer serial number in the `Password` field.

Click `Certificate List` in the `Authentication` section, and click
`create` to generate a new **Self-Signed Certificate**. The `Common
Name` should be automatically filled out. If not, fill it in with the
printer IP address number. Select the years the certificate will be
valid in the `Validity
Period` field, click `Create`, and `Reset` or manually restart the
printer.

The self-signed certificate is generated. Reload the page and click
`SSL/TLS` in the `Security` section to ensure **Selfsigned Certificate**
is correctly selected in the `Server Certificate` section.

Export a self-signed certificate

The export process is heavily dependent on the `OS (Operating System)`
and the browser. Start by accessing your ePOS printer settings on your
web browser by navigating to its IP address (e.g.,
<span class="title-ref">https://192.168.1.25</span>). Then, force the
connection as explained in the **Generate a self-signed certificate
tab**.

If you are using **Google Chrome**,

1.  click `Not secure` next to the search bar, and `Certificate is
    not valid`;
    
    ![Connection to the printer not secure button in Google Chrome

2.  go to the `Details` tab and click `Export`;

3.  add <span class="title-ref">.crt</span> at the end of the file name
    to ensure it has the correct extension;

4.  select `Base64-encoded ASCII, single certificate`, at the bottom of
    the pop-up window;

5.  save, and the certificate is exported.

Windows 10

Windows 10 manages certificates, which means that self-signed
certificates must be imported from the certification file rather than
the browser. To do so,

1.  open the Windows File Explorer and locate the downloaded
    certification file;

2.  right-click on the certification file and click `Install
    Certificate`;

3.  select where to install the certificate and for whom - either for
    the `Current User` or all users (`Local Machine`). Then, click
    `Next`;

4.  on the <span class="title-ref">Certificate Store</span> screen, tick
    `Place all certificates in
    the following store`, click `Browse...`, and select `Trusted Root
    Certification Authorities`;

Mac OS

On Mac OS, you can secure the connection for all browsers by following
these steps:

1.  open Safari and navigate to your printer's IP address. Doing so
    leads to a warning page;
2.  on the warning page, go to `Show Details --> visit this website -->
    Visit
    Website`, validate;
3.  reboot the printer so you can use it with any other browser.

web browser that has not been mentioned, search for
<span class="title-ref">export SSL certificate</span> +
<span class="title-ref">the name of your browser or operating

## Check if the certificate was imported correctly

To confirm your printer's connection is secure, connect to its IP
address using HTTPS. For example, navigate to
<span class="title-ref">https://192.168.1.25</span> in your browser. If
the SSL certificate has been applied correctly, you should no longer see
a warning page, and the address bar should display a padlock icon,
indicating that the connection is secure.
