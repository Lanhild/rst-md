Welcome to the Getting Started Odoo tutorial\! If you reached this page
that means you are interested in the development of your own Odoo
module. It might also mean that you recently joined the Odoo company for
a rather technical position. In any case, your journey to the technical
side of Odoo starts here.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to get an insight of the most
important parts of the Odoo development framework while developing your
own Odoo module to manage real estate assets. The chapters should be
followed in their given order since they cover the development of a new
Odoo application from scratch in an incremental way. In other words,
each chapter depends on the previous one.
