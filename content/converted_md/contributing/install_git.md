[Install
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). It
is a command-line (`a text interface`) tool that allows tracking the
history of changes made to a file and, more importantly, working on
different versions of that file simultaneously. It means you do not need
to worry about overwriting someone else’s pending work when making
changes.

Verify that the installation directory of Git is included in your
system's <span class="title-ref">PATH</span> variable.
