# Commands and Canned Responses

Using canned responses can help you save time and have a previous,
well-thought response, to some of your most common questions and
comments.

## Use commands

Commands are shortcuts that do specific actions within the chat window:

1.  **/help**: shows a help message.
2.  **/helpdesk**: creates a helpdesk ticket.
3.  **/helpdesk\_search**: searches for a helpdesk ticket.
4.  **/history**: shows the last 15 visited pages.
5.  **/lead**: creates a new lead.
6.  **/leave**: leaves the channel.

| - For *helpdesk tickets*: make sure the application is installed on
your database and the option *Live Chat* under `Helpdesk -->
Configuration --> Helpdesk Teams` is enabled. | - For *leads*: the *CRM*
application must be installed on your database.

To access the ticket or lead created from the chat, click on the
shortcut link.

Helpdesk tickets created from the chat automatically add the
conversation as a description of the ticket. The same goes for the
creation of a lead.

## Send canned responses

Canned responses allow you to have a full piece of text being placed
when you type a shortcut word. To create them, go to `Live Chat -->
Configuration --> Canned Responses`.  
To use them during a conversation, simply type **:** followed by the
shortcut word you created.
