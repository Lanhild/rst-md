# Manage Fiscal Years

In most cases, the fiscal years last 12 months. If it is your case, you
just have to define what is the last day of your fiscal year in the
accounting settings. By default, it is set on the 31st December.

However, there might be some exceptions. For example, if it is the first
fiscal year of your business, it could last more or less than 12 months.
In this case, some additional configuration is required.

Go in `accounting --> configuration --> settings` and activate the
fiscal years.

You can then configure your fiscal years in `accounting -->
configuration --> fiscal years`.
