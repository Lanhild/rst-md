## Spanish Chart of Accounts

In Odoo, there are several Spanish Chart of Accounts that are available
by default:

  - PGCE PYMEs 2008
  - PGCE Completo 2008
  - PGCE Entitades

You can choose the one you want by going in `Accounting -->
Configuration` then choose the package you want in the **Fiscal
Localization** section.

Be careful, you can only change the accounting package as long as you
have not created any accounting entry.

When you create a new Odoo Online database, the PGCE PYMEs 2008 is
installed by default.
