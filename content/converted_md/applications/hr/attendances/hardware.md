## Kiosk management

A kiosk is a self-service station that allows employees to check in and
check out for work shifts.

There are two ways to set up a kiosk:

  - **Laptop and desktop PC**
    
    Running a kiosk in a web browser is the cheapest and most flexible
    option. You can print employee badges with any thermal or inkjet
    printer compatible with your web browser.

  - **Tablet and mobile phone (Android or iOS)**
    
    Tablets and mobile phones take up much less space, and their
    touchscreens are easy to use. Consider putting them in a secure
    stand at the front desk or mounting them securely on a wall.

Employees can scan personal RFID key fobs with an RFID reader to manage
check-ins and check-outs quickly and easily.

## Barcode scanners

Employees can scan the barcode on their employee badges to manage
check-ins and check-outs quickly and easily. The kiosk mode works with
most USB barcode scanners connected directly to a computer. Bluetooth
barcode scanners are also supported natively.

We recommend using the [Honeywell product
line](https://sps.honeywell.com/us/en/products/productivity/barcode-scanners).
If the barcode scanner is connected directly to a computer, it must be
configured to use the computer's keyboard layout.
