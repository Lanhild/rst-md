# How to sell in foreign currencies

Pricelists can also be used to manage prices in foreign currencies.

  - Check *Allow multi currencies* in `Invoicing/Accounting -->
    Settings`. As admin, you need *Adviser* access rights on
    Invoicing/Accounting apps.
  - Create one pricelist per currency. A new *Currency* field shows up
    in pricelist setup form.

To activate a new currency, go to `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Currencies`, select it in the list and press *Activate* in the top-right
corner. Now it will show up in currencies drop-down lists.

Prices in foreign currencies can be defined in two fashions.

## Automatic conversion from public price

The public price is in your company's main currency (see `Accounting -->
Settings`) and is set in product detail form.

The conversion rates can be found in `Accounting --> Configuration -->
Currencies`. They can be updated from Yahoo or the European Central Bank
at your convenience: manually, daily, weekly, etc. See `Accounting -->
Settings`.

## Set your own prices

This is advised if you don't want your pricing to change along with
currency rates.
