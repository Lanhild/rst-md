# Payment terminals

Connecting and integrating a payment terminal with your POS system
allows you to accept multiple payment options, including credit and
debit cards, making the payment process more efficient.

## Configuration

Go to the `application settings <../configuration>`, scroll down to the
`Payment
Terminals` section, and tick your terminal's checkbox.

terminal](terminals/settings-pt.png)

Then, follow the corresponding documentation to configure your device:

  - `Adyen configuration <terminals/adyen>`
  - `Ingenico configuration <terminals/ingenico>`
  - `SIX configuration <terminals/six>`
  - `Vantiv configuration <terminals/vantiv>`

Once the terminal is configured, you can `create the corresponding
payment method and add it to
the POS <../payment_methods>`.
