# Payment methods

To add a payment method, you first need to create it. Go to `Point of
Sale -->
Configuration --> Payment Methods --> Create`. Set a name and select a
`payment terminal
<payment_methods/terminals>` for card payments or check `Cash` for cash
payments.

go to `Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Point of Sale` and select a
POS for which you wish to make the payment method available. Click
`Edit` and add the payment method under the `Payments` section.
