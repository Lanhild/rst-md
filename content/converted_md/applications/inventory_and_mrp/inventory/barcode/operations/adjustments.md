open the *Barcode* app. Then, from the application, click on *Inventory
Adjustments*.

If you want to fully work with barcodes, you can download the sheet
*Commands for Inventory*.

Once you have clicked on *Inventory Adjustments*, Odoo will
automatically create one. Note that, if you work with multi-location,
you first need to specify in which location the inventory adjustment
takes place.

If you donâ€™t work with multi-location, you will be able to scan the
different products you want to include in the inventory adjustment.

Besides using the barcode scanner, you can also manually add a product
if necessary. To do so, click on *Add Product* and fill the information
in manually.
