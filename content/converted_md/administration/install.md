# Install

Depending on the intended use case, there are multiple ways to install
Odoo - or not install it at all.

  - `Online <install/online>` is the easiest way to use Odoo in
    production or to try it.
  - `Packaged installers <install/packages>` are suitable for testing
    Odoo and developing modules. They can be used for long-term
    production with additional deployment and maintenance work.
  - `Source install <install/source>` provides greater flexibility, as
    it allows, for example, running multiple Odoo versions on the same
    system. It is adequate to develop modules and can be used as a base
    for production deployment.
  - A [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo/) base image is available
    for development or deployment.

## Editions

There are two different editions.

**Odoo Community** is the free and open-source version of the software,
licensed under the [GNU
LGPLv3](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/master/LICENSE). It is the
core upon which Odoo Enterprise is built.

**Odoo Enterprise** is the shared source version of the software, giving
access to more functionalities, including functional support, upgrades,
and hosting. [Pricing](https://www.odoo.com/pricing-plan) starts from
one app free.
