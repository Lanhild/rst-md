# Your first module

## Overview

This chapter helps you to create your first Odoo module and deploy it in
your Odoo.sh project.

This tutorial requires `you created a project on Odoo.sh
<odoosh-gettingstarted-create>`, and you know your Github repository's
URL.

Basic use of Git and Github is explained.

The below assumptions are made:

  - *\~/src* is the directory where are located the Git repositories
    related to your Odoo projects,
  - *odoo* is the Github user,
  - *odoo-addons* is the Github repository,
  - *feature-1* is the name of a development branch,
  - *master* is the name of the production branch,
  - *my\_module* is the name of the module.

Replace these by the values of your choice.

## Create the development branch

### From Odoo.sh

In the branches view:

  - hit the `+` button next to the development stage,

  - choose the branch *master* in the *Fork* selection,

  - type *feature-1* in the *To* input.

    ![pic2](first_module/firstmodule-development-fork.png)

Once the build created, you can access the editor and browse to the
folder *\~/src/user* to access to the code of your development branch.

### From your computer

Clone your Github repository on your computer:

``` bash
$ mkdir ~/src
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo-addons.git
$ cd ~/src/odoo-addons
```

Create a new branch:

``` bash
$ git checkout -b feature-1 master
```

## Create the module structure

### Scaffolding the module

While not necessary, scaffolding avoids the tedium of setting the basic
Odoo module structure. You can scaffold a new module using the
executable *odoo-bin*.

From the Odoo.sh editor, in a terminal:

``` bash
$ odoo-bin scaffold my_module ~/src/user/
```

Or, from your computer, if you have an `installation of Odoo
<../../install/source>`:

``` bash
$ ./odoo-bin scaffold my_module ~/src/odoo-addons/
```

If you do not want to bother installing Odoo on your computer, you can
also `download this module structure template
<first_module/my_module.zip>` in which you replace every occurrences of
*my\_module* to the name of your choice.

The below structure will be generated:

    my_module
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── __manifest__.py
    ├── controllers
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── controllers.py
    ├── demo
    │   └── demo.xml
    ├── models
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── models.py
    ├── security
    │   └── ir.model.access.csv
    └── views
        ├── templates.xml
        └── views.xml

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

Do not use special characters other than the underscore ( \_ ) for your
module name, not even an hyphen ( - ). This name is used for the Python
classes of your module, and having classes name with special characters
other than the underscore is not valid in Python.

</div>

Uncomment the content of the files:

  - *models/models.py*, an example of model with its fields,

  - *views/views.xml*, a tree and a form view, with the menus opening
    them,

  - *demo/demo.xml*, demo records for the above example model,

  - *controllers/controllers.py*, an example of controller implementing
    some routes,

  - *views/templates.xml*, two example qweb views used by the above
    controller routes,

  - *\_\_manifest\_\_.py*, the manifest of your module, including for
    instance its title, description and data files to load. You just
    need to uncomment the access control list data file:
    
    ``` xml
    # 'security/ir.model.access.csv',
    ```

### Manually

If you want to create your module structure manually, you can follow the
`/developer/tutorials/getting_started` tutorial to understand the
structure of a module and the content of each file.

## Push the development branch

Stage the changes to be committed

``` bash
$ git add my_module
```

Commit your changes

``` bash
$ git commit -m "My first module"
```

Push your changes to your remote repository

From an Odoo.sh editor terminal:

``` bash
$ git push https HEAD:feature-1
```

The above command is explained in the section `Commit & Push your
changes
<odoosh-gettingstarted-online-editor-push>` of the `Online Editor
<odoosh-gettingstarted-online-editor>` chapter. It includes the
explanation regarding the fact you will be prompted to type your
username and password, and what to do if you use the two-factor
authentication.

Or, from your computer terminal:

``` bash
$ git push -u origin feature-1
```

You need to specify *-u origin feature-1* for the first push only. From
that point, to push your future changes from your computer, you can
simply use

``` bash
$ git push
```

## Test your module

Your branch should appear in your development branches in your project.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-branch.png)

In the branches view of your project, you can click on your branch name
in the left navigation panel to access its history.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-branch-history.png)

You can see here the changes you just pushed, including the comment you
set. Once the database ready, you can access it by clicking the
*Connect* button.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-database.png)

If your Odoo.sh project is configured to install your module
automatically, you will directly see it amongst the database apps.
Otherwise, it will be available in the apps to install.

You can then play around with your module, create new records and test
your features and buttons.

## Test with the production data

You need to have a production database for this step. You can create it
if you do not have it yet.

Once you tested your module in a development build with the demo data
and believe it is ready, you can test it with the production data using
a staging branch.

You can either:

  - Make your development branch a staging branch, by drag and dropping
    it onto the *staging* section title.
    
    ![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-devtostaging.png)

  - Merge it in an existing staging branch, by drag and dropping it onto
    the given staging branch.
    
    ![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-devinstaging.png)

You can also use the `git merge` command to merge your branches.

This will create a new staging build, which will duplicate the
production database and make it run using a server updated with your
latest changes of your branch.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-mergedinstaging.png)

Once the database ready, you can access it using the *Connect* button.

### Install your module

Your module will not be installed automatically, you have to install it
from the apps menu. Indeed, the purpose of the staging build is to test
the behavior of your changes as it would be on your production, and on
your production you would not like your module to be installed
automatically, but on demand.

Your module may not appear directly in your apps to install either, you
need to update your apps list first:

  - Activate the `developer mode <developer-mode>`

  - in the apps menu, click the *Update Apps List* button,

  - in the dialog that appears, click the *Update* button.
    
    ![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-updateappslist.png)

Your module will then appear in the list of available apps.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-mymoduleinapps.png)

## Deploy in production

Once you tested your module in a staging branch with your production
data, and believe it is ready for production, you can merge your branch
in the production branch.

Drag and drop your staging branch on the production branch.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-mergeinproduction.png)

You can also use the `git merge` command to merge your branches.

This will merge the latest changes of your staging branch in the
production branch, and update your production server with these latest
changes.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-mergedinproduction.png)

Once the database ready, you can access it using the *Connect* button.

### Install your module

Your module will not be installed automatically, you have to install it
manually as explained in the `above section about installing your module
in staging databases
<odoosh-gettingstarted-firstmodule-productiondata-install>`.

## Add a change

This section explains how to add a change in your module by adding a new
field in a model and deploy it.

  - From the Odoo.sh editor,
    
      - browse to your module folder *\~/src/user/my\_module*,
      - then, open the file *models/models.py*.

  - Or, from your computer,
    
      - use the file browser of your choice to browse to your module
        folder *\~/src/odoo-addons/my\_module*,
      - then, open the file *models/models.py* using the editor of your
        choice, such as *Atom*, *Sublime Text*, *PyCharm*, *vim*, ...

Then, after the description field

``` python
description = fields.Text()
```

Add a datetime field

``` python
start_datetime = fields.Datetime('Start time', default=lambda self: fields.Datetime.now())
```

Then, open the file *views/views.xml*.

After

``` xml
<field name="value2"/>
```

Add

``` xml
<field name="start_datetime"/>
```

These changes alter the database structure by adding a column in a
table, and modify a view stored in database.

In order to be applied in existing databases, such as your production
database, these changes requires the module to be updated.

If you would like the update to be performed automatically by the
Odoo.sh platform when you push your changes, increase your module
version in its manifest.

Open the module manifest *\_\_manifest\_\_.py*.

Replace

``` python
'version': '0.1',
```

with

``` python
'version': '0.2',
```

The platform will detect the change of version and trigger the update of
the module upon the new revision deployment.

Browse to your Git folder.

Then, from an Odoo.sh terminal:

``` bash
$ cd ~/src/user/
```

Or, from your computer terminal:

``` bash
$ cd ~/src/odoo-addons/
```

Then, stage your changes to be committed

``` bash
$ git add my_module
```

Commit your changes

``` bash
$ git commit -m "[ADD] my_module: add the start_datetime field to the model my_module.my_module"
```

Push your changes:

From an Odoo.sh terminal:

``` bash
$ git push https HEAD:feature-1
```

Or, from your computer terminal:

``` bash
$ git push
```

The platform will then create a new build for the branch *feature-1*.

![image](first_module/firstmodule-test-addachange-build.png)

Once you tested your changes, you can merge your changes in the
production branch, for instance by drag-and-dropping the branch on the
production branch in the Odoo.sh interface. As you increased the module
version in the manifest, the platform will update the module
automatically and your new field will be directly available. Otherwise
you can manually update the module within the apps list.

## Use an external Python library

If you would like to use an external Python library which is not
installed by default, you can define a *requirements.txt* file listing
the external libraries your modules depends on.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

\- It is not possible to install or upgrade system packages on an
Odoo.sh database (e.g., apt packages). However, under specific
conditions, packages can be considered for installation. This also
applies to **Python modules** requiring system packages for their
compilation, and **third-party Odoo modules**. - **PostgreSQL
extensions** are not supported on Odoo.sh. - For more information,
consult our [FAQ](https://www.odoo.sh/faq#install_dependencies).

</div>

The platform will use this file to automatically install the Python
libraries your project needs.

The feature is explained in this section by using the [Unidecode
library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode) in your module.

Create a file *requirements.txt* in the root folder of your repository

From the Odoo.sh editor, create and open the file
\~/src/user/requirements.txt.

Or, from your computer, create and open the file
\~/src/odoo-addons/requirements.txt.

Add

``` text
unidecode
```

Then use the library in your module, for instance to remove accents from
characters in the name field of your model.

Open the file *models/models.py*.

Before

``` python
from odoo import models, fields, api
```

Add

``` python
from unidecode import unidecode
```

After

``` python
start_datetime = fields.Datetime('Start time', default=lambda self: fields.Datetime.now())
```

Add

``` python
@api.model
def create(self, values):
    if 'name' in values:
        values['name'] = unidecode(values['name'])
    return super(my_module, self).create(values)

def write(self, values):
    if 'name' in values:
        values['name'] = unidecode(values['name'])
    return super(my_module, self).write(values)
```

Adding a Python dependency requires a module version increase for the
platform to install it.

Edit the module manifest *\_\_manifest\_\_.py*

Replace

``` python
'version': '0.2',
```

with

``` python
'version': '0.3',
```

Stage and commit your changes:

``` bash
$ git add requirements.txt
$ git add my_module
$ git commit -m "[IMP] my_module: automatically remove special chars in my_module.my_module name field"
```

Then, push your changes:

In an Odoo.sh terminal:

``` bash
$ git push https HEAD:feature-1
```

In your computer terminal:

``` bash
$ git push
```
